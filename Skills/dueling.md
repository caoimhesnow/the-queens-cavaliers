## Dueling

The Dueling skill lets you make attacks using a dueling weapon, such as
a sword, a knife, a quarterstaff, or even a pike.

**Wounds:** Dueling rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your
Wounds.

### Lunge

*Verve Specialty*

A Lunge is a basic attack and can be attempted with any hand-held
weapon, and is the most common way of dealing damage to an opponent in a
close-up fight. It can be opposed by any Defense specialty.

**Wounds:** Lunge rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate a dueling weapon's quality, remember the
names of famous duelists, identify the national origin of someone's
fencing style.

**Crafting:** Swords and polearms, as described in Chapter 10,
"Crafting."

**Opposition:** A Lunge can be defended against with any Defense roll.

Wounds than her Wound Limit (which is four for player characters, and
from one to four for non-player characters), she falls unconscious and
is dying.

**Break Weapon:** You snap your target's blade. You can only do this if
your target attempts to Parry your attack and fails. A broken weapon is
useless except as an improvised weapon.

### Riposte
