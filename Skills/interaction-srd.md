## Interaction

The Interaction skill covers social interactions between individual
characters, as well as characters addressing a group.

**Automatic Competency:** Player characters are automatically Competent with the Interaction skill.

**Language:** If you and the other parties don't share a common
language, you gain a Drop 2 penalty on all Interaction rolls.

### Inspire

*Verve Specialty*

The Inspire specialty covers all attempts to instill a particular
feeling in another person (or group of people) – such as to make her
angry, enthusiastic, happy, frightened, or sad.

Inspire isn't a kind of mind control; someone won't take an action that
they are opposed to doing. But you can provoke her to give some kind of
reaction to your words.

**Language:** If you and the other parties don't share a common
language, you gain a Drop 4 penalty on all Interaction rolls.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Recall an inspiring speech from history or fiction,
remember the names of great leaders.

**Opposition:** In most situations, an Inspire roll is an automatic
success. If you have a language barrier or other Drop Penalty applied,
the difficulty increases to Easy (3D6) or higher.

**Inspiring Speech:** Your words start to sway those who hear them. You
can create a tag based on an emotional state, with a +1D0 Tag Die. This
Tag Die lasts until the end of the scene, and can be used with other
Specialties as a Bonus Die when appropriate. You can make one additional
Tag with a +1D0 Bonus Die for each success point you spend.

**Increase Tag Die: **One Tag Die created by your inspiring speech
improves by one die size. You are limited by the number of skill ranks
you have in Interaction (Inspire), as shown on the following table:

###### Maximum Tag Die

| Inspire Rank | Bonus Die |
| ------------ | --------- |
| 1            | \+1D0     |
| 2            | \+1D6     |
| 3            | \+1D8     |
| 4            | \+1D10    |
| 5            | \+1D12    |

**Reduce an Ally's Yield:** If an ally who can hear you has taken Yield,
you can reduce it by spending two Success Points per point of Yield.

**Inflict 1 Yield:** One opponent who can hear you takes one Yield for
every two Success Points you spend on Yield. If her Yield equals or
exceeds her Yield Limit, she is Yielded Out. 

**Instill Emotion:** Choose one of the Tags you have active in this
scene. That specific Tag Die immediately ends for you. One person who
can hear you gains either a Drop Penalty or a Bonus Die on all actions
related to that Tag, your choice. For each additional success point you
spend, you can affect another person. The Drop Penalty decreases after
each time it's applied, and the Bonus Die decreases in size after each
use.

###### Inspire Results

| Tag Die | Drop Penalty | Bonus Die |
| ------- | ------------ | --------- |
| \+1D0   | Drop 1       | \+1D6     |
| \+1D6   | Drop 2       | \+1D8     |
| \+1D8   | Drop 3       | \+1D10    |
| \+1D10  | Drop 4       | \+1D12    |
| \+1D12  | Drop 4       | \+1D12    |

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Provoke Reaction:** You cause someone who can hear you to react to
your words, even if she doesn't really want to. Choose one of the Tags
you have active in this scene. That specific Tag Die immediately ends
for you. The person you've affected will react on her next turn based on
that Tag. You don't get to choose the specific reaction, and it's
instead based on how she would normally react to such feelings. For
example, if you use a Tag Die of Anger, her response might be to attack
you, to fire a scathing insult at you, to burst into tears, to order
someone else to attack you, to leave the area, or to mock your clothing
choices.

### Negotiate

*Affinity Specialty*

Negotiate covers diplomatic attempts to persuade someone, to compromise,
or give something up in return for something else. In general, to use
Negotiate you must be offering a bargaining chip of some kind, although
it need not be a completely fair trade. 

**Language:** If you and the other parties don't share a common
language, you gain a Drop 4 penalty on all Interaction rolls.

**Time:** A Negotiate roll for something simple, like haggling over
goods, takes one minute. More complicated business deals or diplomacy
take an hour or more.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate the price of an object, recall details on
treaties, remember something the other party might have overlooked.

**Crafting:** Contracts, treaties, and other legal documents, as
described in Chapter 10, "Crafting."

**Opposition:** Negotiate rolls are always opposed by the other party's
Negotiate rolls. If there isn't a party in opposition to you, you
probably aren't in a negotiation.

###### Negotiate

**Time:**        1 minute or 1 hour   \
**Opposition:**  Negotiate            \
**+:**           Float a Proposal     \
**\++:**         Refine the Offer     \
**\++:**         Counter-Offer        \
**\++:**         Put it in Writing    \

**+++:**         Gain 1 Style Point   \
**\+++:**        Close the Deal       \
**\++++:**       Gain the Upper Hand  \

**Float a Proposal:** You propose a course of action, and create a +1D0
Tag Die based on that proposal. Until the end of the scene, you can use
that Tag Die as a Bonus Die on appropriate rolls, including further
Negotiate rolls -- or Wealth rolls if you are haggling over a purchase.
If you create a new proposal, the old Tag Die ends.

**Refine the Offer:** For every two success points you spend, the Tag
Die of your existing proposal increases by one die size.

**Counter-Offer:** If the other party has a Tag Die, you can decrease
her die size by one step, or remove her Tag Die entirely if she has a
+1D6 Bonus Die. 

**Put It In Writing:** You get the other party to agree to sign a
written document after you close the deal.

**Reach Compromise:** You and the other party come to a compromise that
benefits you both equally, more or less, and you close the deal. All Tag
Dice created by either party immediately end.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Close the Deal:** You end the negotiation. Whatever you and the other
party have agreed upon is how it the terms will remain, and the other
party won't renegotiate terms in this scene. If you are haggling over a
purchase, you can use the Tag Die of your proposal as a Bonus Die on
your wealth roll; if the other party has a Tag Die, she can add that to
the opposition roll.

**Gain the Upper Hand:** You end the negotiation. You get what you were
hoping to gain without major concessions. The other party loses Tag Dice
she may have created during the negotiation.

### Deceive

*Guile Specialty*

Deceive is the ability to tell a believable lie, avoiding telltale
quirks and pitfalls that might reveal your duplicity. Lies which are
obviously untrue and unbelievable impose a penalty of Drop 1 to Drop 4,
at the Gamemaster's discretion.

**Language:** If you and the other parties don't share a common
language, you gain a Drop 4 penalty on all Interaction rolls.

**Time:** Deception rolls are made after each new, major claim is made,
so could occur after 30 seconds of rambling, or hours of prolonged
storytelling.

**Knowledge Rolls:** This Specialty is not often used to make knowledge
rolls.

**Crafting:** An alternate identity or a simple disguise, as described
in Chapter 10, "Crafting."

**Opposition:** Use the Intuition specialty of each person who is
listening to the lies.

###### Deceive

**Time:**       Free Roll          \
**Opposition:** Intuition          \
**+:**          Think on Your Feet \
**++:**         Appear Sincere     \
**+++:**        Gain 1 Style Point \
**++++:**       Appear Trustworthy \

**Think on Your Feet:** You come up with something quickly so that you
don't look like you're obviously making something up. You can create a
+1D0 Tag Die based on your lie that you can use as a Bonus Die on
appropriate rolls until the end of the scene. Attempts by others to
disprove your lie, through logical deduction or knowledge rolls, are
made against Easy (3D6) standard opposition.

**Appear Sincere:** You lie while giving the impression that you really
do believe what you're saying. For every two success points you spend,
the Tag Die of your lie increases by one die size and the difficulty of
disproving the lie increases by one step.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Appear Trustworthy:** Even if your lie is later exposed as false,
those who heard it still believe you that you didn't intend to deceive
them. Maybe you were mistaken, or they misheard you, or you misspoke.
