## Class Descriptions

### The Duelist

A Duelist is a swashbuckling swordfighter who lives by her wits and her
skill at her blade. She may be a member of the Queen's Cavaliers, or a
rival organization, or may be a freelance fencer who runs her own
dueling school. Quite a few actors have been known to take up dueling as
well.

Duelist is appropriate to accompany any other class in *The Queen's
Cavalier.* As swordfighting is so prevalent in the game, the Duelist
class is a natural choice for most appropriate character concepts.
That's why they're presented out of alphabetical order here.

In other words, if you can't decide on a second class, choose Duelist.

another person, she will usually be represented in court by a Barrister.
Barristers have special training in the law and court procedures, and
are skilled at speaking before a magistrate.

Some Barristers work for the Crown and prosecute lawbreakers, while

A recent and controversial policy in Gallinea allows for the indigent
poor to be represented by public defenders, paid for by the Crown.

### The Brigand 

While Gallinea and most of the Elaran continent are long-settled, that
doesn't always stop opportunists from engaging in banditry. The typical
Brigand in Gallinea is a peasant or even a minor noble whose fortunes
fell and they resorted to force of arms to make their living.

Not all Brigands are necessarily cruel; there's a long history of folk
heroes who rob from the corrupt rich and distribute their loot among the
poor.

### The Chaplain 

A Chaplain is a clergy member of an organized religion, usually Asrian.
The duties can vary but many times a Chaplain is found serving among
military members or as a member of the court. Chaplains have minimal
training in combat but are skilled at interacting with people.

Most Chaplains in Gallinea follow the Asrian faith, devoted to the
goddess-empress Eserre. Dodekan priests from Achalia are also found as
Chaplains, although rarely outside of the Achalian Islands. Devraist
priests are known as Speakers, and it's rare to meet a Devraist
Chaplain. Dualitarian Chaplains are sometimes co-classed as Speakers,
however.

### The Charlatan

called upon to heal battlefield injuries, such as musket wounds or
arrows to the knee.

their patients; many of these are charmwoven to improve their surgical

****In the Gallinean justice system, the Crown is represented by two
separate yet equally important groups:**** the Constabulary, who
investigate crime, and the Crown Barristers who prosecute the offenders.
The Constables – and their counterparts in neighboring countries –
enforce the laws and protect the people from wrongdoers as well as
capturing those who commit criminal acts.

Most Constables are employed by the Crown or a local province, while a

### The Courtier

Members of the Gallinean royal court, and other noble courts, are
Courtiers. They are well-educated, trained in etiquette and social
graces, and have preternatural skill for plotting and intrigue.

Courtiers revel in their lives of luxury, but all know that they only
continue to have such glamorous lives at the forbearance of their
matrons and patrons. A Courtier who is outcast from polite society may
return to take revenge upon a noblewoman or nobleman.

Magicks and the sciences are a draw to the Courier, as well as some
martial pursuits; nobles often have time to develop such skills at their
leisure.

### The Dogsbody

A Dogsbody is a common manservant or henchperson, one who assists
another in their escapades and only rarely comes up with a cunning plan.

### The Provincial 

Outside of the cosmopolitan sprawl of Lutetia are the provinces of
Gallinea – home to commoners and petty noblefolk, many of whom lack
education and refinement. These Provincials – and the Provincials of
other nations – are looked down on by the city folk.

Provincials who come to Lutetia often feel they have something to prove
when dealing with residents of the capital city; it's not uncommon for
brawls to break out in bars because someone's clothes or horse was
insulted.

A few Provincials are minor nobles and choose the Courtier co-class,
although they rarely are afforded the respect given to their urban
cousins.

### The Provocateur 

A revolutionary, a spy, an assassin, a traitor, a conspirator – these
are terms used to speak of the Provocateur, a shadowy figure enmeshed in
plots within plots. Provocateurs are used by all nations of Elara,
although they are rarely trusted even among those who employ them.

A typical Provocateur does not advertise her profession, so she will

### The Speaker

A Speaker is an adherent of the Desert Mother, Devra, whose purpose in
Gallinea is to convert the masses. Devraism is legal within Gallinea but
is in conflict with the majority Asrian religion. For this reason,
Speakers usually keep a low profile while spreading their messages of
stoic living and opposition to secular authorities.

Few, if any, Speakers are loyal to the Gallinean crown; Speakers are
usually opponents for the Queen's Cavaliers rather than allies.

### The Veteran 

Gallinea and its neighbors maintain standing armies, composed of
professional soldiers who fight in their wars at home and abroad. The
most recent war between Gallinea and Albia lasted for a total of 20
years, ending 6 years ago with the marriage of then-princess Mariana
(now Queen Mariana) to prince Carolus of Albia.

### The Witch

An ancient tradition that predates the Qartan Empire, the Witches of
Gallinea are experts at folk remedies, herbal lore, midwifery, and
reading omens. Witchcraft is officially tolerated in Gallinea, although

Some Witches are publicly known as such, but most keep their rituals
secret from the authorities, remembering past periods of persecution.
