### The Dogsbody

A Dogsbody is a common manservant or henchperson, one who assists
another in their escapades and only rarely comes up with a cunning plan.
A Dogsbody is often overlooked by those of higher social rank, and other
servants and lower-class commoners are more likely to talk to a Dogsbody
openly than to the manservant's master.
