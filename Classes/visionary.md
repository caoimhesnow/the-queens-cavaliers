### The Visionary

A Visionary is someone whose genius far exceeds that of the average
person. True Renaissance women and men, they are able to apply logic and
science ways that seem almost supernatural to many.

A Visionary may be a leader, or she may be a quiet follower who only
seeks to pursue her life's work. Visionaries are usually well-educated
and can speak confidently on a variety of topics.
