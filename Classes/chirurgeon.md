### The Chirurgeon

The science of medicine is the domain of the Chirurgeon, who both treats
diseases and injuries, and performs major surgeries. They are often
called upon to heal battlefield injuries, such as musket wounds or
arrows to the knee.

Chirurgeons often wear black bird-headed Plague Masks when treating
their patients; many of these are charmwoven to improve their surgical
skills. Chirurgeons are not adverse to using magicks when appropriate,
including alchemical remedies.
