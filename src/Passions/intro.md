# Passions {.breakbefore}

Characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers* are passionate, and their passions
often spur them on to fantastic success or dismal failure.

Each character is defined by four Passions that are ranked with Passion
Dice, from D12 at the highest, down to D10, D8, and D6 at the lowest.
The size of each Passion Die indicates the relative strength of that
Passion in the character's life.

You must always have one passion at D12, one at D10, one at D8, and one
at D6, and they must all be different Passions. (You can't double up
with the same Passion with two different dice sizes.)

In addition, each of your Passions is embodied by another character,
living or dead, as the Personification of that Passion in your character's mind.

## Using Passions

You can use your character's Passions when roleplaying, by making
decisions that reflect the role her Passions play in her thoughts.

In addition, Passions can also be used with Style Points for game
benefits. Passions can be used in one of three ways:

- Indulge your Passion during a scene to gain 1 Style Point.
- Add your Passion die to a roll by spending 1 Style Point.
- Struggle with your Passion to make it harder for you to succeed at something -- and when you fail, you gain a free Style Point.

### Indulge Your Passion

During a scene, if your character takes the time to focus on her Passion
to the exclusion of other activities, you can gain 1 Style Point – but
only up to the normal maximum of three Style Points at any one time. You
can only do this once per Passion, per session.

For example, someone whose Passion is their Faith may engage in prayer,
while another person who has a Passion for Knowledge may engage in
scientific discovery or reading a new book.

As with any time in which a Style Point is gained, you must describe how
your character is acting with style.

### Add Your Passion Die

By spending a Style Point, you can add one Passion Die to a Dice Pool
under the following conditions:

- Your Passion must be related to the roll that you are making.
- You have not already added that Passion to a die roll in this session.

You need to have a good reason why your success or failure hinges on
your character's Passion – for example, perhaps your character is
motivated to succeed because of her sense of Pride, or her desire for
more Wealth. If you can't justify how your character's Passion would
influence the outcome, you can't spend the Style Point and can't include
your Passion Die.

### Struggle With Your Passion

Sometimes your character's Passion isn't a benefit, but is a hindrance.
In such cases you can choose to struggle with that Passion by adding the
appropriate Passion Die to the opposing Dice Pool when the MJ makes a
dice roll.

If your roll then fails, you gain 1 Style Point and get to describe how
your character's Passion conflicted her and caused her to fail. If your
roll succeeds, you don't gain this Style Point.

You can only choose to do this when the roll is related to your
character's Passion, as with adding the Passion Die to your own roll; in
addition, you can only do this once per Passion per session.

## Inverted Passions

Sometimes, one's love for something can be twisted into pain. These are
known as inverted passions; rather than being passionate toward the
object of your Passion, you're opposed to it.

You decide when you select a Passion whether it's normal or inverted.
You probably shouldn't have more than one inverted Passion for a
starting character, although your Passions may become inverted during
the course of game play. (See "Changing Passions", below.)

## List of Passions

The following is a list of the most common Passions that drive
characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers*. You can pick from this list or
write your own custom Passion.

Several of these Passions require additional definition, such as
specifying the Country that you're passionate about, or the group you're
loyal to. You can record this beside the Passion die on your character
sheet

| Passion            |
| :----------------- |
| Artistry           |
| Church             |
| Country            |
| Faith              |
| Family             |
| Friends            |
| Justice            |
| Knowledge          |
| Love               |
| Loyalty            |
| Lust               |
| Pride              |
| Wealth             |

### Artistry

A character with a Passion for Artistry is drawn toward things of
beauty, be they works of art, music, science, or nature. Such characters
are often either artists themselves, or patrons of the arts.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
**Countess Lusienne Castenia,** the Lady-Mayor of Gallinea,
loves nothing more than a grand party to welcome the start of a new
play, the opening of a new gallery, or the arrival of an artiste from
far-away lands. She has a strong Passion for Artistry, even though she
herself is not artistically talented.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Artistry, Inverted:** The ugliness of your soul drives you to destroy
things of beauty rather than cherish them.

### Church

A character with a Passion for the Church is devoted to the hierarchy of
a religious institution, most commonly the Asrian church under the
direction of the Matriarch.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::
![Farrazin, by Eleanor Ferron](assets/Portraits/Small/guardian-farrazin.jpg "Farrazin, by Eleanor Feron")

**Arch-Chaplain Farrazin**, Guardian of the Faith of Gallinea,
is a very devout man, yes. But ultimately his loyalty is less to the
teachings of the goddess Essere than to her church. Raised in an Asrian
orphanage, Farrazin rose through the ranks to become the most powerful
chaplain in Lutetia -- and there's nothing he won't do for the Church of
Essere.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Church, Inverted:** You despise all that the Church stands for, seeing
them as one of the greatest threats to your life and those of others.

### Country

Passion for one's Country is usually, although not always, the same as a
Passion for the ruler of that country. The Passions may conflict if one
has Loyalty toward one group or cause who opposes the current
government.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
**Baudouin de Longpre,** the duke of Rhodope, is one of the
rare male heads of a province. As the oldest child of his parents, who
had no daughter to inherent the throne, he became duke upon his mother's
death. The Rhodope family have supported the Throne for generations;
they were loyal to the late Queen Elisse III and remain steadfast
loyalists to her daughter, Queen Mariana II. The crown is more than the
head that wears it.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Country, Inverted:** Your country has done you wrong -- either through
deliberate malice or "benign" neglect. Your ire may be directed against
all people of that nation, or just against the ruling parties.

### Faith

As contrasted with Passion for the Church, Passion for one's Faith is
less about the religious organization and more about the beliefs. It's
possible (and quite common) to have both Passions, or also to have just
one or the other.

Devrans usually have a Passion for Faith but no Passion for the Church,
because worship of the Desert Mother isn't based around a complex church
hierarchy as with the Asrians.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Isabene de la Justicia, by Eleanor Ferron](assets/Portraits/Small/isabene-de-la-justicia.jpg "Isabene de la Justicia, by Eleanor Feron")

**Matriarch Isabene de la Justicia,** Bride of the Sun, is the
head of the Asrian church -- some say she practically *is* the church.
However, her strongest commitment is to her deity and (ceremonial) wife,
Essere, goddess of the Sun. Unlike some, such as Farrazin, Guardian of the Faith
for Gallinea, she doesn't put the church hierarchy over her own principles.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Faith, Inverted:** You reject the Faith that once filled your heart
with joy. No longer a true believer, you work to convert others to leave
that religion just as you have.

### Family

Characters with strong familial ties have a Passion for Family. This can
include one's extended family and household, or may just be one's
immediate family – such as parents or children.

::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
**Prince Jean-Remy** is not merely Queen Mariana's favorite
uncle, but is also Gallinea's spymaster and head of Her Majesty's Secret
Service. Haunted by his failure to detect and thwart the assassination
of his sister Queen Elisse and niece Jehanne, Jean-Remy would do
whatever it takes to prevent harm to any of his family.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Family, Inverted:** You're the one decent person in a family of
terrible people -- or perhaps the only terrible person in a family of
saints. You're determined to prove to your kin that they were always
wrong about you.

### Friends

Some people are very faithful to their Friends and would do anything for
them – even die for them in some cases. You can decide if this applies
to all your character's friends or just her closest friends.

::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Gabriana Secouriste, by Eleanor Ferron](assets/Portraits/Small/gabriana-secouriste.jpg "Gabriana Secouriste, by Eleanor Feron")

**Gabriana Secouriste** is a young member of the Queen's
Cavaliers. Personable and easy-going, she makes friends easily and is
slow to lose them. Sometimes her loyalty to her friends makes her
take risks to protect them even if they don't want her help.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Friends, Inverted:** You keep to yourself and don't form any
friendships. Why? Because at one time in the past, you felt horribly
betrayed by someone you trusted, and it's hard for you to call anyone
"friend" again, no matter how nicely they're acting.

### Justice

The cause of Justice is a higher calling to right that which is wrong in
the world. The Passion may stem from an innate sense of right and wrong,
but more commonly it is a reaction to some act of terrible injustice
that has been perpetrated against the character or the ones she holds
dear.

::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
**Andreos Grimani,** the High Elector of Ekalia, began his
public service as a member of the Vigiles Urbani in his home polis of
Imera. He went on to become a judge, before retiring to enter politics.
First elected to the Plenum 15 years ago, he became the ranking Elector
of Imera, then the Senior Elector of Justice, and finally the High
Elector -- a position he has held now for three years. Andreos is known
for his strong drive toward justice as well as his detailed knowledge of
the laws of Ekalia and neighboring countries.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Justice, Inverted:** The concepts of fairness and justice are a lie
designed to keep us all docile sheep. Flaunting the law through blatant
displays of criminal activity is your favorite way to subvert the status
quo.

### Knowledge

Dedication to the pursuit of Knowledge can be expressed through a desire
to learn the truth behind mysteries, to explore the world, or to learn
all that can be learned.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::
As a princess, **Mariana of Gallinea** was much more interested
in scientific pursuits and clockwork engineering than she was in courtly
rituals and noble intrigues. She was a top student at the Royal
Gallinean Academy of Sciences when her mother and older sister were
assassinated, forcing her to take up the Crown. In truth, she'd really
rather be in a laboratory than in the royal palace.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Knowledge, Inverted:** There are some things that the common people
were not meant to know. Only you can be fully trusted with these
secrets, and you'll do what's necessary to stop that Knowledge from
falling into the wrong hands.

### Love

Romance is the most common expression of a Passion for Love, although
there are other types of Love that qualify. Love may be for a single
person, or someone's heart may be divided among many loves.

:::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
**Prince-Father Michel Aubene,** the widower of late Queen
Elisse III and father of current Queen Mariana II, was very much in love
with his wife, and she with him. When they first met, she was not
impressed with the rich southern boy who came to "play cavalier" in
Lutetia and guard then-Princess Elie. After she saved him during an
attack on her life, love soon blossomed. Even the dark bonds of death
can't quell the love Michel feels for Elisse.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Love, Inverted:** Love hurts, scars, wounds, and marks. You knew you'd
never love that way again, and now you're all out of love. All you want
is someone who won't hurt you, won't hurt you no more. But does that
person even exist?

### Loyalty

The Passion of Loyalty is about dedication to a specific person or
group. You must specify who is the subject of your character's Loyalty
if you choose this Passion. You might not actually like the people
you're loyal to, but this isn't about friendship but honor.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Martine Deveaux, by Eleanor Ferron](assets/Portraits/Small/martine-deveaux.jpg "Martine Deveaux, by Eleanor Feron")

**Martine Deveaux** was once a faithful and loyal member of the
Queen's Cavaliers, willing to die for the organization and those within
it. After a disastrous mission with the Cavaliers where she was made the
scapegoat, she turned on her former companians. Now a mercenary
assassin, Martine hates the Cavaliers as much as she used to love them.
This is now an example of an inverted passion.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Loyalty, Inverted:** You can't trust anyone. They might demand your
loyalty or pledge it to you, but no one is actually faithful. Be on
guard, for anyone may betray you at any time.

### Lust

The Passion of Lust is about following one's baser desires, usually
expressed through sexual pleasure. Characters who are Passionate about
Lust can be flirty, teasing, or promiscuous.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
**Genevieve de Longpre,** eldest daughter of the Duke of
Rhodope, is renowned for her string of love affairs -- most of which
ended poorly. It's said she has at least one girl in every port, and
perhaps even more! Hopefully they won't all meet at the same time.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Lust, Inverted:** Actually, it's about ethics in sexual relationships.
You're one of the good people, and yet the objects of your desire keep
gravitating away from you and toward inferior mates! They'll pay for
making you involuntarily celibate.

### Pride

A Passion for Pride means a character is highly focused on her own
dignity and reputation. Affronts to such Pride are met with strong
challenges, as such things are not to be tolerated.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Although only 13 years old, **Prince Philippe of Gallinea** has
more pride than an entire village of Scanbrians. The youngest grandchild
of late Queen Elisse III and nephew of the current Queen, he firmly
knows he is the most important person in Lutetia, save his aunt Mariana.
And sometimes even more important, he believes.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Pride, Inverted:** Life feels like a succession of failures, but
that's okay -- you deserve such misery, right? The best you can hope for
is to scrape by, surviving. Sure, it would be really nice if things
turned around, but how likely is that to happen?

### Wealth

Individuals with a Passion for Wealth are focused on the acquisition,
maintenance, and spending of sums of money. Some come from poor
backgrounds and wish to move beyond their humble beginnings, while
others are rich misers who count every penny.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
**Jennevive d'Angelet** is the Duchess of Scanbria and head of
the richest family in the north of Gallinea. She and her husband, Lord
Gerhardt, are well-known throughout the City of Scanbreille for their
parsimonious ways, although rumors circulate that she is saving up for a
major purchase. What that might be, no one is sure.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Wealth, Inverted:** Money? Who needs money? It just leads to
temptation. You give all of yours away as soon as you get it, usually to
worthy charities or individuals. You might even steal from the wealthy
to give to the impoverished.

## Personifications

A Personification is someone who represents, to that character, the
associated Passion – for good or for ill.  

For example, someone with a Passion for family may think of her beloved
mother who taught them how to hunt – or she could think of her
overbearing grandfather who always demanded more than she could provide.
Someone with a Passion for Country could be intensely loyal to the Queen
herself, or could idolize a revolutionary writer from last century.

Personifications are a way to tie your character to the world and
provide the MJ with non-player characters for you to interact with. A
Personification could be living or dead, an existing NPC or a completely
new one created by the player.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Queen Mariana personifies Country, by Eleanor Ferron](assets/Portraits/Small/queen-mariana.jpg "Queen Mariana personifies Country, by Eleanor Feron")

Dani has the following Passions: Loyalty D12, Pride D10, Country D8, Love D6.

Her Personification of Loyalty is Sir Pierre du Prowe, an older member
of the Queen's Cavaliers who taught her how to swordfight. Dani's Pride
is personified in her rival, Elise Raymonde, another cavalier recruit
whose skill with the blade matches her own. For Country, Dani looks to
the Queen of Gallinea herself, Marianna, as embodying all that is good
and right in her home nation. And for Love, she can't help but think of
the peasant girl Hersent who she grew up with, her first crush.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Changing Passions

During your character's life experiences, her priorities may change.
After a game session you can make one of the following changes based on
what happened during that session:

  - Swap two "adjacent" passions, such as your D12 Passion and your D10 Passion.
  - Invert one of your Passions.
  - Revert one of your inverted Passions.
  - Change out your D6 Passion for a Passion you don't already have.

When you swap, invert, or revert your Passions, your Personifications
may or may not change; it's up to you to decide.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: toolbox ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
MJ's Toolbox: Passion Rolls

In addition to using Passions to earn or spend Style Points, you can
have players make a Passion Roll at the beginning of a game session.
Such rolls give hints as to what is on the character's mind at the
moment and a way to challenge that character's motivations in a
meaningful way.

To make a Passion Roll, a player rolls all of the dice for her Passions
– a D6, a D8, a D10, and a D12. The die that rolls the highest
indicates which Passion is in play for that session.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Dani has the following Passions: Loyalty D12, Pride D10,
Country D8, Love D6. She rolls her Passion dice, getting these results:

:::::::::::: dice :::::::::::
D12: 5, D10: 7, D8: 6, D6: 3
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The high roll is the 7 and it's on the D10. Her D10 Passion is Pride,
which means that Dani may face a situation where her Pride is tested.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

One of the simplest things to do is to have the player's Personification
of that Passion make an appearance, or a story hook related to that
Personification. In some cases it may not be possible – such as a
long-dead grandparent – but even then, it pays to get creative. Maybe
the character finds a long-lost letter, meets up with an old enemy of
her grandparent, or even has a portentious dream about her ancestor.

The Passion Roll is a tool for improvising roleplay and shouldn't be
seen as a constraint on your storylines – you can make the result of the
roll as important or unimportant as you wish.

If your style as an MJ runs toward planning instead improvisation, you
can have your players make Passion rolls at the end of a game session
and use the results to decide what plot elements to introduce in the
next game.

In an ongoing campaign, it's likely that the same Passion will come up
repeatedly. You can ameliorate this effect by removing from the pool the
die corresponding to whichever Passion came up in the immediately
previous session.
