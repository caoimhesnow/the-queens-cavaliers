# Foreign Weapons

In addition to the common and uncommon dueling weapons listed in the
previous tables and aimed weapons later in this chapter, the nations
of Elara and Ifran have their own weapons as well. These
national weapons are described <a href="#the-countries-of-elara" class="xref-inchapter">Countries of Elara</a>
and <a href="#the-countries-of-ifran" class="xref-inchapter">Countries of Ifran</a>. 

  - **Albia:** claymore, dirk, longbow, tuck
  - **Ekalia:** brandestoc, cinquedea, hook prothesis
  - **Northern Ifran:** horsebow, jambiya, shamshir
  - **Ondala:** espada ropera, montante
  - **Talania:** koncerz, szabla
  - **Varendia:** colichedemarde, katzbalger, zweihander

The availability of foreign dueling weapons is the same as that of
uncommon weapons -- 1D0 in a capital city, 1D6 in any other city, and
1D8 in villages -- at least, when you're in that foreign country.

For neighboring countries, the availability of foreign dueling weapons
is 1D6 in a capital city, 1D8 in any other city, and 1D12 in villages.
In far-distant countries, the availability increases to 1D8 in a capital
city, 1D12 in any other city, and unavailable in smaller settlements.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

  - **Brandestoc (Ekalia):** This pole weapon can be mistaken for a
    quarterstaff at first glance, but when the wielder gives a sharp thrust,
    three blades emerge from the end. [This is a Drop 2 action, and it gives the brandestoc the Reach quality until the end of the current scene.]{.gamestats}
    
  - **Cinquedea (Ekalia):** Ekalian sailors who may have to fight in close
    quarters favor this dueling dagger, which has a broad blade nearly equal to that of a sword.
    
  - **Claymore (Albia):** The Albian greatsword is used primarily by those
    of Mathac heritage and is closely identified with Bear Island.
    
  - **Colichedemarde (Varendia):** []{.comingsoon} small sword
    
  - **Dirk (Albia):** []{.comingsoon} dagger
    
  - **Espada Ropera (Ondala):** Some might say this is "only" a rapier,
    but it's well-known that the swordcrafters of Ondala produce the finest
    rapiers in the world. Perfectly balanced, the espada ropera is desired
    by fencers across Elara.
    
  - **Hook Prosthesis (Ekalia):** []{.comingsoon}
    
  - **Jambiya (Northern Ifran):** This curved knife is a common tool across
    Northern Ifran, and can inflict nasty wounds if it gets past a target's
    defenses.
    
  - **Katzbalger (Varendia):** This heavy Varendish long sword is designed
    for chopping -- arms, shields, legs, armor, whatever. [When used with both hands, the Weapon Die increases to 1D10.]{.gamestats}
    
  - **Koncerz (Talania):** []{.comingsoon} sabre
    
  - **Montante (Ondala):** []{.comingsoon} greatsword
    
  - **Shamshir (Northern Ifran):** []{.comingsoon} scimitar
    
  - **Szabla (Talania):** []{.comingsoon} sabre
    
  - **Tuck (Albia):** []{.comingsoon} [As with other long swords, using a tuck with both hands increases the Weapon Die to 1D10.]{.gamestats}
    
  - **Zweihander (Varendia):** []{.comingsoon} greatsword
