# Aimed Weapons

:# Maximum Range?

The tables below don't specify a maximum distance for long range. That's
because areas are an abstract representation of distance, not exact
measurements. Under ideal conditions, a weapon that has the long range
quality could reach 10 or more areas away, depending on how the areas
are set up for that encounter; in a crowded city street, the effective
range will be much lower.

Ultimately it's up to the MJ to decide what the maximum effective range
is for any weapon used at extreme long range, although usually not more
than 10 areas.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

An Aimed weapon is one that can be used with the Military (Aim)
specialty. Larger ranged weapons are usually explosive weapons and use
the Science (Blackpowder) specialty for attacks.

**Aimed Weapon Prowess:** There are five types of weapon prowess that
are used with Aimed weapons. You can add the weapon's Item Die to the
dice pool when making an attack roll with Aim if you have the
appropriate weapon prowess.

  - **Bow Prowess:** Bows, including crossbows, use the Aim specialty to
    attack, and fire arrows or bolts.
  - **Knife Prowess:** In addition to serving as Dueling weapons, you
    can also throw some knives with the Aim specialty.
  - **Musket Prowess:** Muskets are an Aimed weapon with longer range
    than pistols, usually doing more damage and taking longer to reload.
  - **Pistol Prowess:** An Aimed pistol can be fired with one hand.
  - **Polearm Prowess:** Apart from their use as dueling weapons, some
    polearms -- namely, spears -- can be thrown with the Aim skill.

Aimed Weapon Qualities: In addition to the qualities common to all
weapons, there are five that apply to Aimed weapons: the time needed to
reload, and the effectiveness of the weapon at close, short, medium, and
long ranges.

  - **Reload:** For Aimed weapons that require ammunition, the Reload
    quality indicates what kind of Drop penalty is imposed when
    combining the Reload action with another action. Most muskets have a
    Reload value of Drop 3, and pistols of Drop 2.
  - **Close** Range**:** The Close Range quality is the Drop penalty
    imposed when firing an Aimed weapon at a target within your own
    area. Larger weapons such as bows or muskets tend to have a Drop
    penalty at Close Range.
  - **Short** Range**:** A target that is one or two areas away is at
    Short Range. With very few exceptions, nearly all Aimed weapons have
    no Drop penalty at Short Range.
  - **Medium** Range**:** Medium Range is three or four areas. Most
    Aimed weapons have a Drop penalty at Medium Range. If a weapon
    doesn't have a listed Medium Range, it can't be used to effectively
    attack at that distance.
  - **Long Range:** At five or more areas distant, a target is at
    Long Range. All Aimed weapons that can be used at this distance have
    at least a Drop 1 penalty. If there is no Long Range listed for a
    weapon, it can't be used to attack at Long Range.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

  - **Arbalest:** Also known as a heavy crossbow, the arbalest is harder to use than a common crossbow but packs a larger punch.
  - **Arquebus:** A smaller and lighter musket with shorter range and less firepower.
  - **Blunderbuss:** The flared barrel of this musket makes it easier to reload, but also reduces its effective range.
  - **Caliver:** Another type of musket that can reload faster without the reduced range of the blunderbuss[, but with a smaller Weapon Die]{.gamestats}.
  - **Composite Bow:** A heavier bow with longer effective range and pull.  
  - **Crossbow:** The crossbow uses stored mechanical power to fire bolts, instead of relying upon personal muscle power as a normal bow does.
  - **Double Musket:** The primary advantage of this double-barreled musket is the ability to fire twice, once per barrel, without reloading. [If you choose to fire both barrels in the same shot, the Weapon Die increases to 1D12, but you take a Drop 1 penalty because it's harder to aim. You can reload just one barrel of a double musket with a Drop 3 action.]{.gamestats}
  - **Double Pistol:** Like the double musket, the double pistol allows one shot per barrel without having to reload. [If you choose to fire both barrels in the same shot, the Weapon Die increases to 1D8, but you take a Drop 1 penalty because it's harder to aim. You can reload just one barrel of a double pistol with a Drop 2 action.]{.gamestats}
  - **Dragon:** This heavier version of a pistol is favored by cavalry -- especially Dragoons, who take their name from the use of this large pistol.
  - **Flintlock Musket:** This is a standard musket used by infantry throughout Elara.
  - **Flintlock Pistol:** A single-barrel pistol found all over Elara and Ifran.
  - **Hunting Bow:** This standard bow, also called a shortbow or flatbow, has been used for millennia in pretty much every nation.
  - **Rifled Musket:** With a rifled barrel to provide better accuracy at long range, this musket is the favored weapon of snipers.
  - **Thrown Dagger:** [A dagger doesn't have be reloaded, but you take a Drop 1 penalty to draw it as you would with any other weapon -- and once it's thrown, you don't have it any more.]{.gamestats} [The biggest problem with throwing a dagger is that once you throw it, you don't have it any more.]{.sourcebook}
  - **Thrown Spear:** [Like a dagger, a thrown spear must be drawn first but doesn't require ammunition.]{.gamestats} [Like a thrown dagger, throwing away your spear effectively disarms you.]{.sourcebook}

:# Ammunition

Firing a musket or pistol uses a small amount of blackpowder and a
bullet, while a bow requires an arrow. 

However, in the *The Queen's
Cavaliers*, strict tracking of ammunition and powder doesn't contribute
to the swashbuckling adventure style of the genre. If you have an Aimed
weapon that has a Reload value, you're assumed to have enough powder,
bullets, or arrows to fire your weapon and reload it as many times as
necessary. 

This applies even if you use someone else's weapon, or a
weapon you just picked up -- you just don't track ammo for Aimed weapons
in *The Queen's Cavaliers*. Except, of course, for explosive weapons.
