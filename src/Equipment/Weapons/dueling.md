# Dueling Weapons

Dueling weapons are, by definition, weapons that can be used with the
Dueling skill and its specialties -- Lunge, Riposte, Feint, and Defense
(Parry). Not all weapons can be used with all specialties, however.

**Dueling Weapon Prowess:** The types of Weapon Prowess used with
dueling weapons are:

  - **Cudgel Prowess:** Any Dueling weapon used to bludgeon someone is a
    cudgel.
  - **Knife Prowess:** In addition to serving as Dueling weapons, you
    can also throw some knives with the Aim specialty.
  - **Net Prowess:** A net can be used as a Dueling weapon, although
    it's much more common to see this in Ekalia than in Gallinea.
  - **Polearm Prowess:** A polearm is any long-hafted Dueling weapon,
    typically (but not always) with the Reach quality. 
  - **Sword Prowess:** A Dueling weapon with a blade and a hilt. The
    pointy end goes in the other guy.
  - **Whip Prowess:** Whips are usually used in one hand, and most have
    Reach.

**Dueling Weapon Qualities:** In addition to the qualities common to all
weapons, dueling weapons could have two additional qualities.

  - **Cavalry:** A dueling weapon with the Cavalry quality must be
    used with your Main Hand. If you are using this weapon while riding
    a mount, you can substitute the mount's Item Die for your Weapon Die
    against an unmounted opponent.
  - **Reach:** A dueling weapon with Reach can be used to attack into an
    adjacent area as well as your own.

**Success Table Additions for Dueling Weapons:** Some dueling weapons
have additions to the success tables for specific specialties, such as
Knockdown or additional damage. These are represented by the + notation
for success points after the specialty name, such as Lunge (+++:
Unhorse). On a success with a weapon possessing that quality, you could
spend 3 success points to knock your target off her horse.

  - **Break Weapon:** You snap your target's blade or hilt. You can only
    do this if your target attempts to Parry your attack and fails, or
    if you are performing a Parry yourself. A broken weapon is useless
    except as an improvised weapon.
  - **Disarm:** You can disarm your opponent of the weapon she is using
    to attack you or the weapon she's using to Parry your attack. (This
    can't be used when defending against a Brawl attack.) You get to
    choose if the weapon ends up on the ground in your Area, in an
    adjacent Area, or in your hand if you have one free.
  - **Execute a Riposte:** You can make a Riposte attack. This is the
    only way to use the Riposte specialty; it has to follow a successful
    use of a Specialty or weapon with this effect on its Success Table.
  - **Grab:** You can snag an item worn by your target as long as you
    can see it, the item is Handheld size or smaller, and it's not being
    held by your opponent. You get to choose if the item ends up on the
    ground in your Area, or in your hand if you have one free.
  - **Inflict 1 Wound:** Your opponent takes one Wound. If she takes
    more Wounds than her Wound Limit, she falls unconscious and is
    dying. Weapons with this quality allow you to inflict Wounds for a
    lower cost than usual.
  - **Inflict 2 Wounds:** Your opponent takes two Wounds. If she takes
    more Wounds than her Wound Limit, she falls unconscious and is
    dying. Weapons with this quality allow you to inflict Wounds for a
    lower cost than usual.
  - **Knockdown:** Your target is knocked prone, either in your Area or
    in an adjacent Area. Knocking an opponent into an adjacent Area can
    result in them falling or otherwise taking environmental damage.
    Prone characters suffer a Drop 1 penalty on attack and defense
    rolls, and cannot Move until they stand up; standing up is a Drop 1
    combined action.
  - **Restrain:** You successfully catch your opponent with your weapon,
    holding them in place. A combatant who is held suffers a Drop 1
    penalty on attack and defense rolls; for every two additional
    Success Points you spend, you can increase the Drop penalty by 1, to
    a maximum of Drop 4. Your opponent can escape by making a simple
    check against Standard Opposition, usually using Brawl or a weapon
    attack. On a success, your opponent can break your weapon, let it
    fall in their Area, or grab it themselves.
  - **Unhorse:** If your target is riding a mount, they fall off that
    mount and end up prone. Unhorsing an opponent can result in them
    falling or otherwise taking environmental damage. In addition, your
    mount can make a trample attack right now for free, if it has that
    quality. Prone characters suffer a Drop 1 penalty on attack and
    defense rolls, and cannot Move until they stand up. Standing up is a
    Drop 1 combined action, and remounting is an additional Drop 3
    penalty.

### Availability of Dueling Weapons

As stated <a href="#anchor-wealth" class="xref-insection"></a>, to purchase any item you must roll
against a pool consisting of that item's availability and its cost.

Common dueling weapons are those which aren't hard at all to find any
settlement of decent size, and even in some smaller towns. Those are
listed in the following tables.

The availability of common weapons is almost always 1D0 in settlements
of any size. The exceptions are cutlass, rapier, sabre, and smallsword
-- the common swords -- in a small rural settlement. In such situations,
the availability increases to 1D6.

Table: Common Dueling Weapons

| Weapon       | Cost | Hands          | Weapon Die  | Specialties                         |
| :----------- | :--: | :------------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Buckler      | D6   | Either         | Shield +1D8 | Parry, Block                        |
| Club         | D0   | Main           | Cudgel +1D6 | Lunge                               |
| Cutlass      | D6   | Main           | Sword +1D8  | Parry, Lunge, Riposte, Feint        |
| Dagger       | D6   | Either         | Knife +1D6  | Parry, Lunge, Riposte, Feint, Aim   |
| Quarterstaff | D0   | Both           | Cudgel +1D6 | Parry, Lunge, Riposte, Feint, Brawl |
| Rapier       | D6   | Main           | Sword +1D8  | Parry, Lunge, Riposte, Feint        |
| Sabre        | D6   | Main (Cavalry) | Sword +1D6  | Parry, Lunge, Feint                 |
| Smallsword   | D6   | Either         | Sword +1D6  | Parry, Lunge, Riposte, Feint        |


  - **Buckler:** A buckler is a small shield that can be strapped to your forearm, usually on your non-dominant hand. You can hold an item in that hand but trying to attack with that hand while wearing a buckler gives you a Drop 2 penalty on rolls using either the buckler or that weapon.
  - **Club:** A standard club is simply a piece of wood or metal that you can swing at someone. It's not very sophisticated, but then again, you can likely pick one up wherever you are at any given time.  
  - **Cutlass:** The favored weapon of buccaneers, pirates, and other sailors.
  - **Dagger:** A dagger is a large knife that can also be thrown using the Aim specialty.
  - **Quarterstaff:** A medium-sized pole wielded in both hands that can also be used in a Brawl dice pool as well.
  - **Rapier:** The most common type of Sword in *The Queen's Cavaliers* is a sharp, pointy weapon that can be used for all types of fencing.
  - **Sabre:** A lighter and faster weapon, the sabre is designed to be used from horseback although it functions equally well when dismounted.
  - **Smallsword:** Effectively a smaller, lighter version of a rapier, a smallsword can be used in the same way -- or you could dual-wield two of them if you want.

Uncommon dueling weapons have an availability of 1D0 in a capital city,
1D6 in any other city, and 1D8 in villages and other rural areas. The
one exception is that a bullwhip always has an availability of
1D0.

:# Foreign Weapons

In addition to the common and uncommon dueling weapons listed in the
previous tables and aimed weapons later in this chapter, the nations
that comprise Elara and Ifran have their own weapons as well. These
national weapons are described <a href="#the-countries-of-elara" class="xref-inchapter"></a>
and <a href="#the-countries-of-ifran" class="xref-inchapter"></a>, 

  - **Albia:** claymore, dirk, longbow, tuck
  - **Ekalia:** brandestoc, cinquedea, hook prothesis
  - **Northern Ifran:** horsebow, jambiya, shamshir
  - **Ondala:** espada ropera, montante
  - **Talania:** koncerz, szabla
  - **Varendia:** colichedemarde, katzbalger, zweihander

The availability of foreign dueling weapons is the same as that of
uncommon weapons -- 1D0 in a capital city, 1D6 in any other city, and
1D8 in villages -- at least, when you're in that foreign country.

For neighboring countries, the availability of foreign dueling weapons
is 1D6 in a capital city, 1D8 in any other city, and 1D12 in villages.
In far-distant countries, the availability increases to 1D8 in a capital
city, 1D12 in any other city, and unavailable in smaller settlements.
