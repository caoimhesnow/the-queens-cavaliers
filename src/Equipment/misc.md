Characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers* are assumed to have their housing
and daily nutritional needs met by their Social Rank scores without
having to make Wealth rolls or spend Rewards for normal daily living.
Only unusual expenses, such as a night on the town or an inn stay in a
distant city, need to be paid for separately.

The costs below are fairly standardized across Gallinea, although it's
only the larger towns and cities that have the best food, inns, and
alcohol. As a package, one night's stay for a character and her horse in
an inn with an attached tavern will cost 4D0 for the cheapest room and
food, 3D6+1D0 for good quality, and 3D8+1D0 for the most exquisite food,
drink, and suite.

Characters who go carousing and buy rounds on the house can use the
price of the most expensive alcohol bought as an Item die on their
Streetwise (Carouse) rolls.
