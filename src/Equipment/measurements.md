# Units of Measure {.cbreakbefore}

Various units of measurement are used throughout Elara and Ifran, most of which are based on the Qartan Empire's standardized units. 
These units are those used in Gallinea, although there are equivalent units in most other countries descended from Qarta.

## Weight

The basic measure of weight is the *livre*, which is roughly equal to a U.S. pound.

Table: Units of Weight

| Unit                   | Relative Value | SI Value  |
| :--------------------- | :------------: | --------: |
| *once* or ounce        | 1/16           | 30.6 g    |
| *marc* or half pound   | 1/2            | 245 g     |
| *livre* or pound       | 1              | 490 g     |
| *dekalivre* or *deka*  | 10             | 4.9 kg    |
| *quintal*              | 100            | 49 kg     |

A *quintal* is just over 100 real-world pounds.

## Liquid Volume

The basic measure of liquid is the *pinte*.

Table: Units of Liquid Volume

| Unit         | Relative Value | SI Value  |
| :----------- | :------------: | --------: |
| *demiard*    | 1/4            | 238 ml    |
| *chopine*    | 1/2            | 4.8 ml    |
| *pinte*      | 1              | 950 ml    |
| *quade*      | 2              | 1.9 L     |
| *velte*      | 8              | 7.6 L     |
| *barrique*   | 236            | 225 L     |

A *chopine* is about the size of a real-world (US) pint and is the normal size for an alcohol drink. A *pinte* is nearly a liter and
is a large drink indeed. A *quade* is about half a gallon, while a *velte* is two gallons. The *barrique* is a 60-gallon barrel of 
wine, beer, or some other alcohol.
