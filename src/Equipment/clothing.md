## Clothing Qualities

Articles of clothing have the following qualities:

**Worn On:** Each article of clothing is designed to be worn on a
specific part of your body -- head, shoulders, torso, hands, legs, or
feet. In general, you can wear only one item per location, although you
may be able to stack multiple cloaks on your shoulders under certain
circumstances -- check with your MJ to be sure.

Items worn on or over the legs can't have charms woven into them. 

**Social Rank:** Some items are associated with certain social ranks.
This doesn't restrict what you can wear, regardless of your own social
rank, but it may affect how you and your outfit are seen by others. The
social rank of an article of clothing can be used as an availability die
in a purchase roll.

**Scale:** Articles of clothing are usually handheld scale when carried,
and don't contribute to encumbrance when worn if the optional system for
encumbrance is used. Items wrapped up in a box for gifting or transport
are one scale category higher, including the packaging.

The following table lists the most common types of clothes that are
found in Gallinea. Detailed descriptions of each type of clothing are
given <a href="#articles-of-clothing" class="xref-insection">Articles of Clothing</a>.

## Standard outfits

Many outfits just naturally go together. Every new character starts with
one or two standard outfits depending on her class and backstory. In
addition to sharing a common cost, outfits are all considered part of
the same social rank, regardless of the actual social rank of each
item.

Table: Standard Outfits

**Clockworker outfit (Artisan 1D8):** This is worn while doing
mechanician work, and usually has a lot of extraneous pockets and loops
for tools and gears. The most notable feature is the set of gearspring
goggles, which give an item die bonus of Perceive +1D6 on visual checks.

**Corsair outfit (Soldier 1D6):** Worn by sailors and pirates around the
world, and by many would-be buccaneers, this outfit certainly captures
the look of the chic privateer.

**Courtly outfit (Noble 1D10):** Nobles, and those who must interact
with them, are known for their outlandishly ornate couture and finely
arranged coiffure.

**Crafter outfit (Artisan 1D8):** Similar to a clockworker outfit, a
crafter outfit is for doing productive work, be it artistic, magickal,
or smithing in content.

**Military outfit (Soldier 1D6):** Military outfits come with an
appropriate tabard from the correct military unit, noble house,
mercenary group, or city guard. For example, a veteran/constable may
have one tabard from the Gallinean army, and another from the Lutetia
watch. Military outfits don't come with a torso item, to facilitate the
wearing of armor.

**Peasant outfit (Commoner 1D0):** Plain and practical, peasant outfits
can be found throughout Gallinea, and in nearly every social rank. As
they're easily patched, many peasant outfits are simply stitched
together from different types and colors of fabric. Lately, the upper
social ranks have tried to adopt this patchwork style, albeit with
little success.

**Physician outfit (Artisan 1D8):** The notable feature of this outfit
is the large, vaguely bird-shaped mask used during surgery; the beak of
this mask contains herbs and cloth meant to filter out diseases. Most
physician outfits start out white in color, but quickly become stained
with crimson.

**Priest outfit (Artisan 1D8):** The traditional dress of Asrian clergy
varies by their rank within the church. Lower-ranking chaplains wear
outfits of brighter, primary colors while those higher in the hierarchy
are allowed additional colors that are darker and more complex. 

**Scholar's outfit (Artisan 1D8):** Students and instructors at
universities, seminaries, officer schools, and other institutions of
higher learning are expected to dress in traditional scholarly robes
while teaching or attending classes. Outside of class, of course,
they're free to wear whatever they want.

**Swashbuckler outfit (Soldier 1D6):** The cavalier hat, the billowing
cape, the high boots -- anyone wearing this outfit cuts a dashing figure
indeed. While some such outfits are more sedate and refined, many look
as if the wearer stepped out of the latest Alais de Neversette novella.
