## Armor

Armor is any kind of clothing or shield used to protect the wearer from
attacks. Unlike normal clothing, most types of armor can't be enchanted
by charmweaving. Armor provides an item die, also known as an Armor Die,
that can be used on Block rolls. As with all other item dice, you can't
include more than one Armor Die in any dice pools.

There are three types of armor: Flexible, Rigid, and Shield. Each type
has its own associated armor prowess; if you wear armor of that type but
lack the appropriate prowess, you take a Drop 2 penalty on all combat
rolls (Defense, Dueling, Brawl, Aim).

**Flexible armor: **This type of armor is usually lighter and more
comfortable to wear, although it may not fully protect the wearer. If
you are wearing flexible armor, you can't wear an additional article of
clothing on your torso (although all armor includes sufficient
undergarments for the armor to be worn).

**Rigid armor:** Solid plates of steel or iron provide the defensive
value of a suit of rigid armor. Like flexible armor, you can wear either
armor or torso attire, but not both.

**Shields:** A shield is carried in one hand and can be used for both
Block and Parry rolls. You can't include more than one Armor Die in any
dice pool, so you can't combine the Armor Dice of a shield and armor.

The following table lists the types of armor commonly found in Gallinea;
each of these would have a +1D0 Availability Die in major cities, and
+1D6 elsewhere.

Table: Common Armor

| Armor Type        | Cost | Prowess  | Item Die          |
| :---------------- | :--: | :------: | :---------------- |
| Buckler           | 1D6  | Shield   | Block, Parry +1D8 |
| Leather jerkin    | 1D6  | Flexible | Block +1D6        |
| Steel breastplate | 1D8  | Rigid    | Block +1D10       |

  - **Buckler: **A buckler is a type of small shield commonly used in dueling, usually paired with a rapier or other sword. They're good at deflecting blows as well as setting up an opponent for a riposte.
  - **Leather jerkin: **One of the most commonly worn armors, leather jerkins are simply leather vests or jackets reinforced with cuir bouilli shoulders and chest plates. While some can be decorated with artistic designs (for twice the price), the leather material can't support the enchantments needed for charmweaving.
  - **Steel breastplate: **A hard, steel breastplate, also known as a cuirass, protects the vital organs of its wearer, with the exception of the head. As with most armor, you can't wear both a breastplate and an article of torso clothing, and the armor doesn't support charmweaving.

Some less common armors are shown below. Each has an Availability Die in
a city that equals its cost, and one or more steps higher in smaller
towns.

Table: Uncommon Armor

| Armor Type     | Cost | Prowess  | Item Die           |
| :------------- | :--: | :------: | :----------------- |
| Buff coat      | 1D10 | Flexible | Block +1D8         |
| Gambeson       | 1D8  | Flexible | Block +1D6         |
| Kite shield    | 1D8  | Shield   | Block, Parry +1D10 |
| Maille hauberk | 1D8  | Flexible | Block +1D8         |
| Morion         | 1D6  | Rigid    | Block +1D6         |
| Parade armor   | 1D12 | Rigid    | Block +1D8         |
| Plate armor    | 1D10 | Rigid    | Block +1D12        |
| Valmain-rivet  | 1D6  | Rigid    | Block +1D8         |

  - **Buff coat:** Essentially a longer, reinforced gambeson, buff coats are favored by military officers. As with gambesons, they have charmwoven enchants; they are Soldier (1D6) social rank, can take Military (Brawl, Aim, or Strategy) charms, and are available in the full range of colors used in charmweaving. (See Chapter 9, "Specialty Equipment," for further details on charmweaving.)
  - **Gambeson: **Thick cloth padding makes these jerkins equal to leather in protective value, but the slightly longer construction time means they see less use. However, they can have charmwoven enchants added.  Gambesons are considered to be Soldier (1D6) social rank, can have Defense (Block, Parry, or Dodge) charms added, and are only available in neutral colors. (See Chapter 9, "Specialty Equipment," for further details on charmweaving.)
  - **Kite shield:** Also known as a heater shield, this is larger than a buckler. The size prevents you from effectively using any Main Hand weapon at the same time as the shield.
  - **Maille hauberk: **This is a jacket or vest made of chainmail. The protective benefits in modern Gallinea are outweighed by the time -- and thus the cost -- necessary to produce it.
  - **Morion:** This is an open-faced, steel helmet shaped somewhat like a hat with a ridge down the middle. Morions are favored by guards and infantry. While it gives minimal protection when used alone, it grants a +1D6 Bonus Die to Block rolls if you're wearing a steel breastplate. You can't wear an article of head attire while wearing a morion.
  - **Parade armor: **These are highly decorative suits of plate armor, each one individually made for its wearer. (They're only available in major cities, and even then usually have a +1D12 Availability Die.) Like other suits of plate armor, the wearer takes a Drop 2 penalty on Defense (Dodge), Dueling (Feint), and Nature (Prowl) rolls when parade armor is worn. 

    While the actual protective value of parade armor is less than a suit of plate armor, they are the only type of rigid armor that can take charms.  Parade armor is Noble (1D10) social rank and can be made in any color.  The helmet, breastplate, gauntlets, and boots can each have individual charms. See Chapter 9, "Specialty Equipment," for more information on charmweaving.

    Parade armor helmet charms can be Culture (Arts, Etiquette, Scholarship) or Observation (Perceive, Intuition, Deduce); breastplate charms can be Defense (Block, Parry, Dodge) or Interaction (Inspire, Negotiate, Deceive); gauntlet charms can be Military (Brawl, Aim, Strategy) or Streetwise (Banter, Carouse, Larceny); and boot charms can be Nature (Explore, Husbandry, Prowl) or Dueling (Lunge, Parry, Riposte). The entire suit of parade armor must be worn or none of the charms are active.

  - **Plate armor: **The knights of Varendia are famous for their heavy plate armor, which does provide superior protective ability albeit at the expense of mobility. While you are wearing plate armor, you take a Drop 2 penalty on Dodge, Feint, and Prowl rolls. In addition, you can't wear any additional articles of clothing save for shoulder items such as cloaks or tabards.
  - **Valmain-rivet:** Originally created in Varendia ("valmain" references an older Albian term meaning "Varendish"), these are cheap, easily constructed suits of partial plate armor used for equipping large armies. There's nothing glamorous about them; they're simply functional.  You can't wear torso, head, or arm clothing items while wearing valmain-rivet.
