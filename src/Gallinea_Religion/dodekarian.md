# Dodekarianism {.breakbefore}

Dodekarianism, or the Faith of the High Twelve, is the largest polytheistic religion in Elara.
It originated in Ekalia long before the rise of the Qartan Empire, and even people who
only view it as superstition are familiar with the myths and deities of the Ekalian national
faith.

Reflecting the democratic governance of the Ekalians themselves, the High Twelve are a
council who work as a heavenly version of the polis councils found throughout the islands.

## Symbology

There are two symbols of the Dodekarian faith: a regular geometric solid with twelve sides, 
each pentagonal face containing the symbol of one of the High Twelve; and the dodekahedron, 
commonly found on coins, flags, and other flat surfaces.

## The High Twelve

The gods of the High Twelve are divided between female and male, with an implied
equality between the two genders. The following table summarizes the High Twelve.

Table: The High Twelve

| Deity   | Gender | Sphere of Influence              | Symbol           |
| :------ | :----- | :------------------------------- | :--------------- |
| Dethius | Female | The Middle Sea; Prosperity       | Ripples on Water |
| Demith  | Female | The Night Sky; Justice           | Balanced Sword   |
| Jathys  | Male   | Craftsmanship; Commerce          | Bronze Spear     |
| Keanos  | Male   | The Great Sea; Weather           | Crashing Wave    |
| Koi     | Male   | Exploration; Knowledge           | North Star       |
| Nemosei | Female | Memory; Artistic Inspiration     | Black Harp       |
| Peryon  | Male   | Vigilance; Family                | White Cloud      |
| Reios   | Male   | Politics; The Underworld         | Stone Door       |
| Ronu    | Male   | Agriculture; Plants and Fruit    | Harvest Scythe   |
| Siobe   | Female | The Moon; Portents and Magicks   | Silver Moon      |
| Sybrea  | Female | Motherhood; Animals              | White Swan       |
| Teia    | Female | The Sun; Rulership               | Golden Disc      |

The average Dodekarist doesn't worship a single member of the High Twelve alone;
"this is a single faith with a single pantheon, not a collection of twelve
monotheist faiths!" states an old Ekalian proverb. Instead, respect is paid to
each deity with respect to that god's sphere of influence.

For example, if departing on a voyage of exploration, sacrifices and prayers will
be offered to Koi. Venturing into the Great Sea, Oceanus, requires an invocation
of Keanos. Nemosei hears prayers from artists, and Teia hears prayers from civic
leaders.

### Ashra and Devra

Ekalian philosphers have tried, for centuries, to equate their sun goddess Teia with the
Asrian goddess-empress Ashra, and their night goddess Demith with the Devrans' Desert
Mother. This was the basis of their claim for religious freedom during the Qartan Empire;
"look, we worship the Sun just like you do!"

While there are superficial similarities between the listed gods, neither Asrians nor 
Devrans accept that their monotheistic deity is but one of twelve equal members of 
a polytheistic pantheon. To Devrans, this is a foolish arrogance, and to Asrians, the
disbelief of the Ekalians leads them into outright heresy against Ashra.

## Sibyls

The priests of the High Twelve are known as sibyls, and unlike most Dodekarists,
each sibyl is called by one specific deity to be a voice for that god. While she 
is conversant with all the prayers in the Faith of the High Twelve, a sibyl
sees her position as an analogue for an elector in the Ekalian democratic system.
Rather than speaking for the interests of her city, she speaks for the interests
of that deity.

To know what her god requires of her, a sibyl will use an ancient alchemical brew,
called kykeon, to enter a state of heightened awareness. In such a state, she can
hear and feel her deity directly, and thus know what she must say.

Of course, skeptical non-believers claim that sibyls are just becoming intoxicated
and any voices they hear are within in their own minds, and the interests they
represents are their own with no supernatural component. But who listens to skeptics,
anyway?
