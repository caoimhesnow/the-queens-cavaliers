# The Five Brothers {.cbreakbefore}

Belief in the Five Brothers, also known as the Old Fathers, is an old
religion, at least as old as the High Twelve in Ekalia.

As the name implies, the faith centers on five male deities. According to
ancient legend, these mythic five were the founders -- "Old Fathers" -- of
nations in what are now Bear Island, Albia, Albingia, Varendia, and Talania.
Each taking many wives, they established long dynasties that ruled each northern
land, every northman descended from one of the Five Brothers.

The faith of the Old Fathers teaches the supremacy of men over women, and
glorifies physical strength over skill and knowledge. When each land fell
under the sway of the Qartan Empire, these beliefs were outlawed and driven 
to extinction, replaced by the Asrian Goddess-Empress Ashra. There have
been no worshipers of the Five Brothers in over 1,500 years.

Or so the story goes.

About four hundred years ago, Asrian chaplains discovered that old temples
to the Five Brothers had been unearthed in Varendia and Talania. Inquisitions
were launched and the reborn cult of the Five Brothers was rooted out and
destroyed. There have been no worshipers of the Five Brothers in over 400 
years.

Or so the story goes.

The last 100 years have seen a resurgence in the cult of the Five, reborn again
to spread its peculiar vision of patriarchal masculinity. Although Gallinea
generally promises freedom of religious choice, in the case of the Five Brothers
their beliefs go past simply having a disagreeable set of principles and into
actively exerting physical power over others. "Violence is a sacrement," according
to translated Five Brothers carvings. Accordingly, the religion was outlawed in
Gallinea and so there have been no worshipers of the Five Brothers in 100 years...

The following table lists each of the Five Brothers and the nations that each
is said to have founded.

## The Old Faith and the Five Brothers

Followers of the Old Faith have a different myth about the Old Fathers. Not
gods but mortals, the Five Brothers were the most wicked men of pre-Qartan Elara. 
They committed untold crimes against women, against men, against children.

The most powerful covens of the day came together in threes, in three-times-threes,
in three-times-three-times-threes, in three-times-three-times-three-times-threes.
All told, 243 witches spoke with one voice, listing the crimes of each wicked man.

Borun, the butcher of children. Tul, the butcher of women. Lanonn, the butcher
of men.  Vasi, the violator of children. Diir, the violator of women and men.

Magicks in those days were strong, stronger than they are now. And the hex laid
by three-times-three-times-three-times-three covens-of-three twisted the wicked men 
into the forms of beasts and banished them forever from the lands of warmth.

Few who know the Old Faith speak this story aloud. It is only told in the dead
of winter, in hushed whispers, lest speaking the tale allow the Five Brothers 
to return to the warm lands.  Of the superstitions that comprise the Old Faith, 
it's said that a good quarter of them are meant to ward off the malign influence
of Borun, Tul, Lanonn, Vasi, and Diir.
