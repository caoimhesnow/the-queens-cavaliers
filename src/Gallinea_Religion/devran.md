# Devranism {.cbreakbefore}

Worship of Devra, the Desert Mother, is all but banned in Gallinea since the death of Queen Elisse, 
but that doesn't stop the puritanical Speakers from representing their faith despite persecution. 
Preaching a gospel of strict austerity and rigid discipline, the Devrans claim very simple 
relationships directly with their deity and eschew the complex clerical structure of the Asrians.

## Devra

The Desert Mother is also known as the Queen of the Night. While the darkness of night can hold terrors for those
in colder climes, to those in the blistering Ifrani desert the night is a time of relief, of 
activity, of renewal. Such was the context for the creation of the Devran faith.

## Symbolism

Devra is sometimes represented by a crescent moon, and the stars behind her as ancestors who have passed on.

## *Songs of the Desert Mother*

*Songs of the Desert Mother* is the collective name for ancient poems, songs, hymns, and parables collected over
the millennia by the Devrans. Such scriptures are unique to each Devran, with a different set of *Songs*
based on one's ancestry, family traditions, hometown, and religious community. When two Devrans marry, one of the
most important tasks after the ceremony is for them to sit down and decide which parts of each family's 
*Songs* they wish to preserve within their new family.

## Beliefs

The decentralized religion of the Desert Mother makes it hard to make generalizations about what they
collectively hold important. One Devran's *Songs* might focus on interpersonal relationships, another's
on agricultural practices, and a third's on punishment for crimes.

Basic principles common to all Devrans include worship of the Desert Mother on a new moon, a reverence for
family and history, respect for Devran traditions even if they don't match your own, and holding yourself and
others to strict moral standards.

## The Lost City of Aad

Aad was once the second-largest city in the Qartan Empire, and is located in what is now the Ifrani Desert.
Legend says that the worship of Devra originated in Aad, and for this reason the site is still considered
holy to the faith.

Despite being known as "The Lost City", the location of Aad is fairly well known. The sobriquet refers to 
the vanishing of Aad during the fall of Qarta, and subsequent rediscovery by nomadic traders in the following
centuries. The personal names of those traders are not spoken in Devran tradition, but are simply known
as The Finders.

A pilgrimage to The Lost City of Aad that retraces the steps of The Finders, through rocky mountains and treacherous 
sandstorms, was considered to be a test of faith by devout Devrans centuries ago. The pilgrimage is merely
seen as symbolic now, and is not undertaken by all but the most zealous of Devrans. 

Those who do make it to
Aad find a humble village with a carefully maintained shrine surrounded by date trees nestled among the toppled
columns and walls of the Qartan metropolis. The shrine-keepers will allow anyone to pray there, but ask that
none stay more than a month before departing.

Modern intepretation of the pilgrimage say that each Devran will be tested repeatedly in her faith over
the course of her life, and like The Finders, the only way to make it through the rhetorical sandstorms
is by strict, unwavering devotion to Ashra.

## Speakers

As a faith without an organized hierarchy, the Devrans don't have formal priests as the Asrians do.
Instead, when a Devran feels a calling from Devra, he steps forward and becomes a Speaker for the
Desert Mother. Historically, the role of Speakers was to urge villages and nomadic houses to remain
faithful to the Queen of the Night and to work together for the common good. The Speaker's role isn't
to be a leader but to be a teacher.

The role of the Speaker in modern Devranism is similar, although in non-Devran lands like Gallinea
a Speaker will usually become a community hub whether he wants to or not. The traditional role of
urging the people to remember the Desert Mother instead shifts to spreading knowledge of the faith
and agitating to change in the Asrian society that surrounds them.

## Devrans in Gallinea

In theory, any religion is free to legally practice their faith in Gallinea, one of the key guidelines
in the Elissian Reforms of the last queen.

However, the practice of religious equality, especially that of Devra's followers, has been sorely tested
in the current decade. When Queen Elisse and her daughter Jehanne were murdered by a blackpowder assassination, 
rumors spread throughout Lutetia that tied the Devrans to the plot, even though there was scant evidence
to suggest such a charge. While some on the periphery of the conspiracy have been identified, the core
organizers of the assassination remain unknown, prompting many in Gallinea to pin the blame on the
quiet outsiders with their unknown practices in the dark of night.

Prince Jean-Remy, the queen's spymaster and uncle, has been conducting his own deep investigation into the
murders for years now. Of the key conspirators, he states simply, "They aren't Devran."
