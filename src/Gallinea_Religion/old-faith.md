# The Old Faith {.breakbefore}

The Old Faith is the modern name given to the ancient religion of pre-Qartan
Gallinea. Although thought of now as just folk traditions and superstitions,
the Old Faith is actually comprised of the surviving remnants of aboriginal
Gallinean culture.

Although most in Gallinea don't think of it as a separate religion, the Old Faith 
is a set of folk tales, home remedies, domestic ceremonies, superstitions, and other
beliefs that are followed by members of the lower classes. These practices easily co-exist
with the Asrian faith, with many who follow the Old Faith considering themselves faithful
Asrians. For them, the Old Faith isn't a competing theological and philosophical system
but "just the way we've always done things."

Everyone in Gallinea knows that you don't get married on the 13th of the month, you
always offer the first drink from a bottle of wine to the oldest person present, and
black cats are bringers of good luck ... but few know where, when, and why those beliefs 
originated.

"One for ill, two for luck, three for death, four for birth," goes the crow-counting
song, but who in modern Gallinea recognizes that as an ancient spell of divination? 
Or that "Red is the rose, blue is the violet, gold is the honey, green is the field" is a
maiden's incantation to find a new love before the new moon? Such knowledge is only 
spoken in whispers, never written down in words.

## Beliefs

The core belief of the Old Faith is that the world of nature responds to the
actions we take, the words we speak, the items we gather. By asking the world to
respond, rather than demanding it via force, we can find ourselves in attunement
with nature and with others who seek the same understanding.

Women are central to the Old Faith beliefs, but not exclusively; there is no
prohibition against men, although they are asked to defer to women in ceremonial
practice. This tenet helped the Old Faith survive the arrival of the Asrian faith
in Elara, as the goddess-worshiping Qartans didn't see the Old Faith as a threat
to their theology. 

## Symbology

The Old Faith uses no specific visual identifier, although threes play a major
role in Old Faith numerology.

The aboriginal Gallineans spoke and wrote a language known as *Brigue*, and it
survives now in old chants, "magick words," and carved symbols whose original meanings 
are largely forgotten.

## Witches

The modern Gallinean term *witches* has no negative connotations; the Brigue term
*wynachti* simply referred to the wise, older women of a village. These *wynachti* would
form a leadership council, usually of three women, and make decisions for the good
of all in the village. Over time, these councils became known as *covens*.

As noted before, Qartans didn't feel threatened by the Old Faith ... but in the dark
centuries after the Qartan Empire, many Asrians looked for scapegoats for
the fall of Qarta and in Gallinea those scapegoats were the witches. Between 300 PQ
and 500 PQ, Asrian chaplains persecuted many witches, putting them to death for their
practices even as those same practices lived on as "folk beliefs."

In the Matriarchal Letter of 502, the then-current Bride of the Sun, Oratia Senectus, 
declared oppression of witches to be antithetical to Asrian belief and banned the practice.
By that time, the witches had gone underground among common people of Gallinea and 
thus were reluctant to step forward to publicly accept the Matriarch's apology, but they
did see an end to the violence against their faith.

In the centuries hence, witches have eschewed overt visibility as they fear that no matter
what the arch-chaplains of Cordera say, Asrians may once more decide they need someone
on whom to blame their misfortunes.

Every hamlet, village, or town in Gallinea has at least one witch, her or his identity
an open secret among the commoners, and most settlements of any size have at least one
coven. The village witch is a healer and a midwife, a grower of herbs and a soother of livestock,
a matchmaker and a storyteller. In an age when the nobility cares little for the common
folk, the peasants of Gallinea know that they can rely on the witches as they have for centuries.

## Reading of Portents

The interpretation of natural phenomena, omens, and divination readings has become so
associated with witches that the term *witchcraft* is simply synonymous with *reading of
portents*. Using a variety of techniques -- some ancient Gallinean in origin, some Qartan, 
some Ekalian -- witches and others can call upon their training and legends to see what
lies in someone's future.

The Matriarchal Letter of 502 declared the practice of reading portents to be a valid way 
to understand the will of the Goddess-Empress Ashra, and many devout Asrians place great
stock in a reading of their own immediate futures.

Not everyone who claims to be fortune-teller is a witch; some are students of other
prophetic traditions, and even more are charlatans. Those seeking the true wisdom of
Gallinea's wise women are urged to seek out smaller hamlets and make discreet inquiries
about the village witch, rather than consulting an overly theatrical soothsayer in a
marketplace tent.
