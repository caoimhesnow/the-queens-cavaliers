# Dualitarianism {.breakbefore}

Dualitarianism is a uniquely Albian heresy developed in the last two centuries, 
holding that the Goddess-Empress Ashra and the Desert Mother Devra are the same being,
referred to as Ashradevra. Dualitarians keep the hierarchical structure of the Asrian 
church while adopting the stern moralism of the Devrans. Dualitarianism is legal within 
Gallinea but is regarded with skepticism and often, outright hostility.  Dualitarians are 
sometimes scornfully called Orwandans by members of the Asrian faith, but no Dualitarian 
would ever apply that term to herself.

The Asrian scriptures, the *Books of the Sun*, and the Devran scriptures, *Songs of the Desert Mother*, 
are supplemented by a book written by Dackin Orwand, founder of Dualitarianism, called *Orwand's Revelation*. 
*Revelation* purports to describe the direct equivalence between Devran and Asrian beliefs while 
reinterpreting both to fit the theology of the Dualitarians. 

## Symbology

Dualitarians eschew symbology save for a simple *horizontal cross-ordinary*, symbolizing the 
convergence of the Asrian and Devran religions in a single faith. This symbols is also evident in
the Albian flag.

## Pilgrims

The priests of Dualitarians are known as *pilgrims*. According to legend, renegade Asrian
chaplain Dackin Orwand of Albia undertook a religious pilgrimage to the Lost City of Aad, and there
was taught that Ashra and Devra were one and the same. Upon returning to Dunon, he wrote *Orwand's
Revelation* and started the Dualitarian faith.

In honor of his journey, Dualitarian chaplains are called "pilgrims," although few find it necessary
to undertake a pilgrimage themselves. "Dackin has undergone pilgrimage so that we need not!" says a common proverb.

The Dualitarian church is headquartered in Dunon, the capital of Albia, and is led by Patriarch
Roland Orde, the Son of Ashradevra. Orde rarely leaves Dunon, fearful of meeting his end at the
hands of Ondalan assassins.
