## Defense ## {.breakbefore}

The Defense skill is used in combat to avoid taking damage. Whenever you
are attacked, you can choose which of the appropriate Defense
specialties you will use, although depending on the type of attack, your
Defense choices may be limited by the type of attack. For example, you
can't really Parry a bullet.

**Automatic Competency:** Player characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers*
are automatically Competent with the Defense skill.

**Wounds:** Defense rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your
Wounds.

### Parry

*Verve Specialty*

A Parry is an attempt to block an attack with a weapon or a buckler; you
need to be wielding something in one of your hands in order to make a
Parry.

The primary advantage of a Parry is that if you successfully Parry, you
can also execute a Riposte â€“ if you've got enough Success Points to do
so. You can only execute one Riposte per Parry.

**Wounds:** Parry rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.

**Possibility of Weapon Breakage:** If you use Parry to defend against a
Lunge attack and are unsuccessful, one possible result for the attacker
is to break your weapon.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate a dueling weapon's quality, remember the
names of famous duelists, identify the national origin of someone's
fencing style.

**Crafting:** Bucklers and extra shields<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Opposition:** A Parry can be used against an attacker's Lunge, Feint,
or Brawl roll, but not against a Riposte or Aim attack.

and the attacker from spending her Success Points. If you don't do this,

way to use the Riposte specialty; it has to follow a successful Parry or
Feint.

you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

have Advantage, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum
of D12.

**Disarm:** You can disarm your opponent of the weapon she is using to
attack you. (This can't be used when defending against a Brawl attack.)
You get to choose if the weapon ends up on the ground in your Area, in
an adjacent Area, or in your hand if you have one free.

### Block

*Affinity Specialty*

A Block roll is an attempt to prevent injury to yourself by using armor,
a shield, nearby furniture, terrain, or even a less vulnerable part of
your own body.

**Wounds:** Block rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate the quality of a suit of armor or a
shield, remember the names of famous soldiers, identify the blacksmith's
maker's mark on armor.
