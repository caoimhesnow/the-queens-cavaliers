##  Observation ## {.breakbefore}

The Observation skill encompasses both reading situations and reading
people, as well as putting together disparate clues to see the bigger
picture.

**Automatic Competency:** Player characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers*
are automatically Competent with the Observation skill.

### Perceive

*Verve Specialty*

With a Perceive roll, you can spot a person in a crowd, listen for one
voice in a chorus, notice the smell of burning wood, or detect an ambush
before it happens. The MJ can call for Perceive as a free roll, or you
can make additional rolls by using your action to examine your
surroundings.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Accurately describe someone you have seen or heard,
or identify her from a description.

**Opposition: **Under most circumstances, a Perceive roll is an
automatic success and the number of success points determines how well
you accomplished the task. The standard opposition for spotting someone
or something hidden is determined by the hider's Nature (Prowl) or
Streetwise (Larceny) roll. Trying to Perceive something under difficult
circumstances, such as inclement weather or a crowded tavern, can have a
difficulty of Easy (3D6) or more.

::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::
| Perceive      |                        |
| :------------ | :--------------------- |
| Time:         | Free Roll, or 1 action |
| Opposition:   | Standard Opposition    |
| +:            | Notice the Obvious     |
| +++:          | Gain 1 Style Point     |
| ++++:         | Notice Minor Detail    |
| +++++:        | Notice Hidden Detail   |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Notice the Obvious:** You notice something which is pretty easy to
spot but not directly in front of you, or you spot someone who is hiding
from you. For each additional success point, you spot something else
that isn't directly in front of you or hiding.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Notice Minor Detail:** You notice a small detail about a person, an
animal, an object, a vehicle, or an area that most people wouldn't
catch. For every 2 additional success points, you notice another detail
about the same thing.

**Notice Hidden Detail:** You make note of a tiny detail that someone
has taken pains to hide, disguise, or eliminate.

### Intuition

*Affinity Specialty*

Intuition involves reading subtle cues from your environment, including
non-verbal cues from other people. The MJ can call for Intuition as a
free roll, or you can make additional rolls by using your action to
examine your surroundings.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Remember something that you didn't consciously
notice at the time you saw it, recall someone that you met in your
childhood.

**Opposition: **Under most circumstances, an Intuition roll is an
automatic success and the number of success points determines how well
you accomplished the task. The standard opposition for sensing someone
or something hidden is determined by the hider's Nature (Prowl) or
Streetwise (Larceny) roll, and determining if someone is lying is
opposed by their Interaction (Deceive) roll. Trying to intuit something
under difficult circumstances, such as inclement weather or a crowded
tavern, can have a difficulty of Easy (3D6) or more.

::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::
| Intuition     |                        |
| :------------ | :--------------------- |
| Time:         | Free Roll, or 1 action |
| Opposition:   | Standard Opposition    |
| +:            | Get a Hunch            |
| ++:           | Sense Danger           |
| +++:          | Gain 1 Style Point     |
| ++++:         | Sense Falsehood        |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Get a Hunch:** You have a gut feeling about something, and it's
probably right. You create a +1D0 Tag Die that can be used as a Bonus
Die on any Observation or Initiative rolls until the end of the scene.
The Tag Die is based on one word picked by the MJ. For each additional
success point, the MJ adds another word to the Tag. For every 2
additional success points, you increase the Tag Die by one step, with a
limit based on your ranks in Observation (Intuition) as shown by the
following table:

Table: Maximum Tag Die

| Intuition Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
|  +1             |  +1D0           |
|  +2             |  +1D6           |
|  +3             |  +1D8           |
|  +4             |  +1D10          |
|  +5             |  +1D12          |

**Sense Danger:** You can identify one or more sources of immediate
danger that aren't readily apparent, including an ambush. Every two
Success Points you spend spots another potential source of harm.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Sense Falsehood:** You can tell when someone is lying to you, picking
up on her unconscious tells. You don't know what the truth is, but you
do know you're not hearing it now. For the rest of the scene, you know
when she's telling you the truth and when she's not.

### Deduce

*Guile Specialty*

The Deduce specialty lets you size up a situation and formulate a
scenario in which they make sense, as provided by the MJ. This will
always be a supplement to your own roleplaying and decision-making
processes while playing *The Queen's Cavaliers*; it is not meant to
substitute for player ingenuity. Deduce can also be used to analyze
clues and spot falsehoods.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Remember the solution to a puzzle you've solved
before, decipher a coded message, recall the names of famous detectives.

**Opposition: **Under most circumstances, a Deduce roll is an automatic
success and the number of success points determines how well you
accomplished the task. The standard opposition for detecting someone or
something hidden is determined by the hider's Nature (Prowl) or
Streetwise (Larceny) roll, and determining if someone is lying is
opposed by their Interaction (Deceive) roll. Trying to Deduce something
under difficult circumstances, such as inclement weather or a crowded
tavern, can have a difficulty of Easy (3D6) or more.

::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::::
| Deduce        |                          |
| :------------ | :----------------------- |
| Time:         | Free Roll, or 1 action   |
| Opposition:   | Standard Opposition      |
| +:            | Recognize Clue           |
| ++:           | Reach Simple Conclusion  |
| +++:          | Gain 1 Style Point       |
| ++++:         | Infer Greater Plan       |
| +++++:        | Reach Complex Conclusion |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Recognize Clue:** You realize that something in your current situation
is out of place or doesn't add up. You create a +1D0 Tag Die that you
can use on Observation and Streetwise rolls until the end of the current
scene. The MJ will tell you what the Tag is, but won't tell you what it
means. For 2 additional points you can increase the Tag Die by one step,
to a limit based on your ranks in Observation (Deduce) as shown on the
following table:

Table: Maximum Tag Die

| Deduce Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |
| :----------: | :-------------: |
|  +1          |  +1D0           |
|  +2          |  +1D6           |
|  +3          |  +1D8           |
|  +4          |  +1D10          |
|  +5          |  +1D12          |

**Reach Simple Conclusion:** You draw a basic conclusion from the
available facts. You need to have recognized at least one clue to reach
a conclusion. The conclusion will be simple and straightforward, a la
Ockham's razor, but is not guaranteed to be correct. Each time you find
another clue, you automatically know whether it fits your simple
conclusion or not.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Infer Greater Plan:** You can determine whether or not something was
deliberately done, and if so, become aware that there is more to the
situation than what appears. If you witness more of this plan in action,
you will automatically know that it's part of the same scheme, even if
you don't yet know the role it plays.

**Reach Complex Conclusion:** You draw together several clues to form a
more complex scenario that fits the facts as you understand them. The
complex conclusion is guaranteed to be more accurate than a simple
conclusion, but it may not include all the variables and thus may be
subject to misunderstanding or inaccuracies. Each time you find another
clue or witness more of a plan, you automatically know how to include it
in your complex conclusion.
