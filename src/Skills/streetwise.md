## Streetwise ## {.breakbefore}

Streetwise skill covers the ability to survive and prosper in a medium
or large city, sometimes relating to people of varying Social Ranks.
Streetwise characters are savvy to the right places in town to get
things done, and are good at trash-talking their opponents.

### Banter

*Verve Specialty*

The Banter specialty lets you toss quips and insults both in and out of
a fight, trying to provoke a reaction of some kind. You can use Banter
to demoralize your foes or impress your audience.

**Language:** You can only use Banter on someone who can understand the 
language you're speaking.

**Knowledge Rolls:**  Remember embarrassing details about someone else's 
personal life, recall a scathing retort from a line of a play.

**Time:** Most uses of Banter take only 1 action to perform, although
spreading rumors takes 1 hour.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time spreading rumors to add a Bonus 
Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Streetwise (Banter), as shown on the following table:

Table: Extra Time for a One-Hour Task

| Completion Time   | Bonus Die | Banter Rank Required |
| :---------------- | :-------: | :------------------: |
| 2 hours           | 1D0       |  +1                  |
| 4 hours           | 1D6       |  +2                  |
| 8 hours (1 day)   | 1D8       |  +3                  |
| 16 hours (2 days) | 1D10      |  +4                  |
| 32 hours (4 days) | 1D12      |  +5                  |

**Opposition:**  When directly confronting someone, your Banter roll is 
opposed by their own Banter roll. If you're spreading rumors, the
standard opposition is Easy (3D6) in a medium city and Moderate (3D8) in
a large city.

| ++++:         | Enrage Opponent                  |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Decrease Advantage:** If your opponent has Advantage, you can decrease 
her die size by one step, or remove her Advantage Die entirely if she
has D6 Advantage.

**Increase Advantage:** You gain a D6 Advantage Die if you don't already 
have Advantage, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum of D12.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how 
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Inflict 1 Yield:** Your opponent takes one Yield for every three 
Success Points you spend on Yield. If her Yield equals or exceeds her
Yield Limit, she is Yielded Out. 

**Spread Rumor:**   You spread scurrilous yet believable lies about a 
rival. You create a +1D0 Tag Die based on a person, a place, an animal,
or an object involved in some scandalous way with your rival. You can
use the Tag Die as a Bonus Die on Interaction, Intuition, and Streetwise
rolls against your rival for 1 week (six days). The rumor can't be
easily traced back to you.

For one additional success point, you can extend the duration by one
day. For every 2 additional success points you spend, you can increase
the Tag Die by one step, to a maximum value based on your ranks in
Streetwise (Banter) as shown in the following table:

Table: Maximum Tag Die

| Banter Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |
| :----------: | :-------------: |
|  +1          |  +1D0           |
|  +2          |  +1D6           |
|  +3          |  +1D8           |
|  +4          |  +1D10          |
|  +5          |  +1D12          |

**Enrage Opponent:** If you aren't in a fight already, you provoke your 
opponent into starting combat. If you are in combat, your opponent
will focus on you to the exclusion of other targets, until you're dead,
unconscious, or the fight ends.

### Carouse

*Affinity Specialty*

The Carouse specialty involves frequenting establishments where liquor
is served and tongues accordingly flow more freely. Carousing in a
tavern or bar is a good way to pick up on the local rumors, and maybe
even learn some secrets from a drunken informant.

**Language:** If you don't speak one of the local languages, you get a 
Drop 2 penalty on Carouse rolls.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Locate the best (or worst) taverns in town, 
identify the type and origin of liquor with a taste, recall your
companion(s) in previous drunken trysts.

**Crafting:** Beer, ale, wine, and other alcoholic beverages<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Item Die:** If you buy a round of drinks for everyone in a tavern, you 
can add the highest die in its cost to your Carousing roll as an Item
Die.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time carousing to add a Bonus Die to 
your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of ranks
in Streetwise (Carousing), as shown on the following table:

Table: Extra Time for a One-Hour Task

| Completion Time   | Bonus Die | Carousing Rank Required |
| :---------------: | :-------: | :---------------------: |
| 2 hours           | 1D0       |  +1                     |
| 4 hours           | 1D6       |  +2                     |
| 8 hours (1 day)   | 1D8       |  +3                     |
| 16 hours (2 days) | 1D10      |  +4                     |
| 32 hours (4 days) | 1D12      |  +5                     |

**Opposition:** The larger the city, the easier it is for you to get 
information or make a connection without drawing too much attention to
yourself. In anything smaller than a large town, the standard opposition
is Hard (3D10). In a large town or small city, the opposition is
Moderate (3D8), and in a large city, the opposition is Easy (3D6). If
you go carousing in your usual haunts -- because sometimes you want to
go where everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came --
the roll is an automatic success and the success points are used to
determine how well you performed the task.

two sources, but which still may or may not be true.

### Larceny

*Guile Specialty*

The Larceny specialty is used for criminal endeavors, primarily theft.
You use Larceny rolls not only to steal objects but also fence them and
to purchase stolen goods on the black market.

**Knowledge Rolls:**  Estimate the value of a stolen object, evaluate the 
quality of a lock or door, recall the names and rap sheets of famous
criminals.

**Crafting:**  Locks, traps, alarms, and forgeries<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to perform a Larceny roll by taking
a Drop penalty on your die roll. The size of the Drop penalty depends on
how quickly you rush, as shown on the following table:

Table: Rushing a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| :-------------: | :----------: |
| 45 seconds      | Drop 1       |
| 30 seconds      | Drop 2       |

|  +++:         | Install Obstacle                          |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Case the Joint:** You look around your own Area or an adjacent Area 
and learn one of the following pieces of information:

- The nearest exit, and whether it's locked
- The most valuable object you could carry, and whether it's unsecured
- The location of the nearest guard or other observer
- The location and trigger of a trap or alarm

Each additional Success Point you spend can tell you a different piece
of information, or the next item down within the same category. For
example, a second Success Point could tell you the second nearest exist,
the second-most valuable object, the location of the second-nearest
observer, or the location of an additional trap.

**Steal Something:** You can palm an unattended small item in your Area 
without being seen. For an extra 2 success points, you can remove a
small item from the pocket of someone in the same Area as you. If you
spend an additional 2 success points, you can move it to your pocket or
the pocket of someone else in your Area.

**Bypass Obstacle:** You can pick a lock, bypass a trap, or disable an 
alarm in your Area that would otherwise prevent you from engaging in
criminal activity. If you spend one additional success point, you can
reset the obstacle to become active again once you have left the Area. 

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how 
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Install Obstacle:** You can set a trap, alarm, or lock in your own 
area to trigger once you have left the Area. An Easy (3D6) Observation
roll is required for someone to notice the trap. For each additional 2
success points you spend, the difficulty of the Observation roll
increases by one step, limited by the number of skill ranks you have in
Larceny as shown on the following table:

Table: Maximum Observation Opposition

| Larceny Rank | Standard Opposition   |
| :----------: | :-------------------: |
| 1            | Easy (3D6)            |
