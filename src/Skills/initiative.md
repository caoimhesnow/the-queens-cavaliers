## Initiative ## {.cbreakbefore} 

The Initiative skill is used in combat to determine who goes first, as
well as to take additional actions during a fight. The order of
Initiative is set by a free roll at the beginning of each fight, or when
each combatant enters the fight. 

Generally, a character only needs to have ranks in one Initiative
specialty, usually corresponding to her highest Attribute Die.

**Automatic Competency:** Player characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers*
are automatically Competent with the Initiative skill.

### Impulse

*Verve Specialty*

The Impulse specialty is favored by combatants who have high Verve, and
is characterized by acting quickly to Seize the Initiative.

**Knowledge Rolls:** This Specialty cannot be used to make knowledge
rolls.

**Opposition:** Initiative rolls are automatically successful, and
ranked in order by the MJ from highest (first to act) to lowest (last to
act).

::::::::::::::::: success :::::::::::::::
| Impulse       |                       | 
| :------------ | :-------------------- |
| Time          | Free Roll             |
| Opposition    | Automatic Success     |

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Seize the Initiative:** For one round, you jump ahead in the
Initiative order, before someone else is about to act. The next round,
you act at your normal place in the Initiative order.

**Interpose:** For one attack, you makes yourself the target of someone
else's attack, instead of the attacker's intended target. This can be
used to protect any target in the same Area, or as a combined action
with a Move to protect a target in an adjacent Area. Alternately, an
Interpose can be used to prevent an opponent in the same Area from
leaving that Area; this blocks the opponent's movement but does not
redirect the attack. You can Interpose only once per round.

**Reprise Attack:** If you failed on an attack roll, you can repeat the
attack. This can't be used after a successful attack. You can Reprise
Attack only once per round.

### Vigilance

*Affinity Specialty*

Vigilance is favored by combatants who have high Affinity and who look
to protect others, because they are able to Interpose most easily during
a fight.

**Knowledge Rolls:** This Specialty cannot be used to make knowledge
rolls.

**Opposition:** Initiative rolls are automatically successful, and
ranked in order by the MJ from highest (first to act) to lowest (last to
act).
