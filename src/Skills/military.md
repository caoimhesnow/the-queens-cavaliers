## Military ## {.breakbefore}

The Military skill includes training in ranged combat and unarmed
combat, plus strategic planning. A character with Competency in the
Military skill may have served in as a formal member of the military,
but it's not automatic.

### Brawl

*Verve Specialty*

The Brawl specialty can be used to attack in unarmed combat, and also
defend against the same. You usually need at least one hand free to make
a Brawl attack.

**Wounds:** Brawl rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.

**Holds:** A held combatant receives a Drop Penalty on her Dueling,
Parry, and Aim rolls, and cannot Dodge, Run, or Move. The penalty starts
at Drop 1 when a hold is first achieved, and increases by 1 every time
the hold is increased (see below).

**Crafting:** Quarterstaves, clubs, and other bludgeons<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate someone's unarmed fighting technique after
watching her brawl, recall the names of famous pugilists.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Inflict 1 Yield:** Your opponent takes one Yield for each Success
Point you spend on Yield. If her Yield equals or exceeds her Yield
Limit, she is Yielded Out. 

**Negate Brawl Attack:** You prevent a Brawl attack from doing any
damage to you, and the attacker from spending her Success Points. If you
don't do this, the attack still takes effect on you, with the attacker
spending her Success Points normally.

**Achieve or Break Hold:** You achieve a hold on your target, or if you
are already held, you can break that hold. You can choose to do both in
one roll, if you have enough Success Points. A combatant who is held
suffers a Drop 1 penalty on attack and defense rolls; for every two
additional Success Points you spend, you can increase the Drop penalty
by 1, to a maximum of Drop 4.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Knockdown:** Your target is knocked prone, either in your Area or in
an adjacent Area. Knocking an opponent into an adjacent Area can result
in her falling or otherwise taking environmental damage. A prone
character suffers a Drop 1 penalty on attack and defense rolls, and
cannot Move or Run until she stands up; standing up is a Drop 1 combined
action.

**Disarm:** You can disarm your opponent of the weapon she is wielding.
You get to choose if the weapon ends up on the ground in your Area, in
an adjacent Area, or in your hand if you have one free.

### Aim

*Affinity Specialty*

The Aim specialty covers all kinds of ranged combat, from firing muskets
and bows to throwing daggers. Only Block or Dodge can be used to defend
against an Aim attack, and not Parry.

**Wounds:** Aim rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate the quality of a firearm or bow, identify
the type of weapon used to cause a wound, recall the names of famous
marksmen.

**Crafting: **Bows, crossbows, muskets, and pistols<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

Points you spend on Yield. If her Yield equals or exceeds her Yield
Limit, she is Yielded Out. 

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Inflict 1 Wound:** Your opponent takes one Wound. If she takes more
Wounds than her Wound Limit (which is four for player characters, and
from one to four for non-player characters), she falls unconscious and
is dying.

**Free Reload:** You can reload your weapon if the reload time is Drop 4
or lower

**Knockdown:** Your target is knocked prone. A prone character suffers a
Drop 1 penalty on attack and defense rolls, and cannot Move or Run until
she stands up. Standing up is a Drop 1 combined action.

### Strategy

*Guile Specialty*

Strategy is the ability to make battle plans, both before and during a
fight. Characters with the Strategy specialty are skilled at leading
during combat and reading the way a fight is going.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Identify the leader of an army, evaluate a battle
plan to discover weaknesses, organize a supply line, recall the names of
famous generals.

**Crafting:** Battle plans, tactical maps, and military orders<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Opposition: **Use the Military (Strategy) roll of your enemy's leader.
If there's no leader, your roll is an automatic success and the success
points you spend are used to determine the effectiveness of your
tactics.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


**Read the Fight:** For each Success Point you spend to Read the Fight,
choose one other combatant in the fight. You learn her Competency Die,
current Yield, and Wounds taken. Each additional success point allows
you to get information about an additional combatant.

**Increase Tactical Advantage:** For every two success points you spend,
you can do one of the following: reduce an ally's Yield by 1, increase
your advantage, increase an ally's advantage, or increase an ally's
initiative points by 1.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Decrease Advantage:** Choose one enemy. If she has Advantage, you can
decrease her die size by one step, or remove her Advantage Die entirely
if she has D6 Advantage.

**Give an Order:** Choose a friendly person you can communicate with,
and give her an order that consists of one action. If she chooses to
obey the order, she gains a +1D0 Bonus Die for that action, and can
immediately take the ordered action (such as an attack, a move, or
reloading her weapon), even though it's not her turn. For every 2
additional success points you spend, the Bonus Die increases by one
step, with a limit determined by your ranks in Military (Strategy):

Table: Maximum Bonus Die

| :------------: | :---------------: |
|  +1            |  +1D0             |
