## Nature ## {.cbreakbefore}

Knowledge of the natural world is expressed through Competency in the
Nature skill. Nature is a hands-on skill, learned through experience
rather than book learning.

### Explore

*Verve Specialty*

The Explore specialty lets you navigate through the world, on land, sea,
or even in the air. When appropriate, you can also use Explore to search
for survival needs such as water, food, and shelter. A map of the area,
a compass, or a navigator's astrolabe can provide an Item Die bonus on
the roll.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Recall facts about towns, people, and creatures
found in distant lands, evaluate the quality of a sailing ship or
airship, chart a route on a detailed map, recall the names of famous
explorers and ship captains.

**Crafting:** Maps, rafts, shelters, and other survival gear<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection">Crafting</a>.

**Base Time:** Determining directions or finding a shortcut takes one
minute, and other uses of Nature (Explore) take 1 hour.

**Opposition:** Under normal circumstances, a Nature (Explore) roll is
an automatic success, and the success points determine how well you've
done at your task. Inclement weather or hostile climates have a standard
difficulty of Easy (3D6) or higher.

| [+][+][+][+] | Discover Shortcut      |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Determine Directions:** You know which direction is north, and roughly
which direction you must travel in order to reach your desired
destination.

**Locate a Landmark:** You find a notable and unique feature such as a
geological formation, ruins of a town, or a burnt tree. This helps to
orient you so that you avoid becoming lost. You create a +1D0 Tag Die
based on the name of this location, which you can use on rolls to avoid
becoming lost. The size of the Tag Die decreases by one step for every
two leagues you travel away from the landmark. For every additional 2
success points you spend the initial Tag Die increases by one step,
limited by your specialty ranks in Nature (Explore) as shown on the
following table:

Table: Maximum Tag Die

| Explore Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |
| :-----------: | :-------------: |
|  +1           |  +1D0           |
|  +2           |  +1D6           |
|  +3           |  +1D8           |
|  +4           |  +1D10          |
|  +5           |  +1D12          |

**Find Food and Water:** You manage to find a source of water, and units
of foodstuffs equal to your ranks in Nature (Explore), for every two
success points you spend. The food will last for 24 hours unless somehow
preserved.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Find Shelter:** You find a safe place to camp for the night that is
secure from weather and other dangers for the next 12 hours, for you and
up to 10 other people or horses. You can increase the number you can
shelter by 5 people or horses for an additional success point. For every
additional success point you spend, you can increase the duration by 6
hours.

**Discover Shortcut:** You discover a way to reach your destination 5%
sooner than you expected, often allowing you to intercept another person
or group before they arrive. For each additional success point you
spend, you decrease your travel time by 5%, up to a limit of one success
point per specialty rank of Explore.

### Husbandry

*Affinity Specialty*

Animal handling and crop farming is covered by the Husbandry specialty,
along with dealing with animals of all types, including domesticated
animals such as cows, dogs, horses, or cats. This skill can also be used
with wild animals and naturally occurring plants.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate the quality of a mount, livestock animal,
or edible plant, predict the weather over the next couple of days,
recall the names of local landowners, identify the properties of an
unknown plant or animal.

**Crafting:** Leather goods, flexible armor, and cooked meals<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection">Crafting</a>.

**Wounds:** If you are treating a wounded animal, you have Drop Penalty
based on the animal's wounds.

**Time:** Controlling an animal or riding a horse takes 1 action, and
other uses of Husbandry take 1 hour.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on farming chores to add a
Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your
number of ranks in Nature (Husbandry), as shown on the following table:

Table: Extra Time for a One-Hour Task

| Completion Time   | Bonus Die | Husbandry Rank Required |
| :---------------: | :-------: | :---------------------: |
| 2 hours           | 1D0       |  +1                     |
| 4 hours           | 1D6       |  +2                     |
| 8 hours (1 day)   | 1D8       |  +3                     |
| 16 hours (2 days) | 1D10      |  +4                     |
| 32 hours (4 days) | 1D12      |  +5                     |

**Item Die:** You can add the Weapon Die of a Knife when butchering, the
Item Die of a domesticated animal when gathering crops, tending flocks,
or farming, and the Item Die of chirurgeon's tools when doing veterinary
medicine. For handling a domesticated animal, add the animal's Training
attribute as an Item Die.

**Opposition:** For gathering crops, farming, or butchery, the roll is
an automatic success and your success points are used to determine how
well you perform the task. Handling one of your own domesticated animals
is an automatic success as well.

The standard opposition for using handle animal with a wild animal or an
unfriendly domesticated animal is based the higher of its Instinct or
Ferocity attributes. Handling an animal with D6 Instinct is Easy (3D6),
one with D8 Ferocity is Moderate (3D8), and so on. 

::::::::::::::::: success :::::::::::::
| Husbandry     |                     |
| :------------ | :------------------ |
| Time          | 1 action or 1 hour  |

| [+][+][+]     | Veterinary Medicine |
| [+][+][+]     | Butchery            |
| [+][+][+][+]  | Teach a New Trick   |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Handle Animal:** You can make a domesticated animal perform one of its
tricks, go where you want it to go, or otherwise follow your directions.
With a wild animal, you can either make it flee or convince it to not
attack you and your companions until the end of the scene as long as you
don't approach it. If you're riding a horse, each Success Point you
spend allows you to clear one obstacle such as a fence, hedge, or
stream.

When you successfully use Handle Animal, you create a +1D0 one-word Tag
Die for the animal's attitude toward you that can be used as a Bonus Die
in Nature or Defense checks against that animal. The Tag Die lasts until
the end of the scene, and increases by one step for every 2 success
points you spend, up to a maximum based on your ranks in Husbandry as
shown in the following table:

Table: (table) Maximum Tag Die

| Husbandry Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
|  +1             |  +1D0           |
|  +2             |  +1D6           |
|  +3             |  +1D8           |
|  +4             |  +1D10          |
|  +5             |  +1D12          |

**Gather Crops:** Assuming you have access to a field of crops, you can
harvest 2 units of foodstuffs. For each additional success point you
spend, you can harvest an additional 2 units of foodstuffs.

**Dairy Farming:** Assuming you have access to milk cows, chickens, and
other farm animals, you can harvest 2 units of foodstuffs. For each
additional success point you spend, you can harvest an additional 2
units of foodstuffs.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Veterinary Medicine:** You can heal one Wound that has been inflicted
on an animal in the current scene, or you can decrease the severity of a
disease affecting an animal. Each Wound treated or disease severity
reduced requires that you spend one dose of medicine.

**Butchery:** You slaughter and butcher an animal to create foodstuffs.
An animal can provide a number of foodstuffs equal to its yield limit.
Farm animals provide an additional 50% more foodstuffs.

**Teach a New Trick:** You can teach a new trick to a domesticated
animal. If the animal already knows as many tricks as you have Specialty
ranks of Husbandry, or is an old dog, you can't teach it any new tricks.
For a wild animal, domesticating it counts as one of its tricks.

### Prowl

*Guile Specialty*

The Prowl specialty represents stealthy, secretive movement or action,
usually taken outdoors where there is sufficient cover or shadows to
hide from observers.

You make a Prowl roll as an action when you are not hidden and attempt
to do so, or as a free roll if you are already out of sight and someone
is looking for you. If you move from your location without moving
undetected, you must make another Prowl roll.

**Wounds:** Prowl rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Remember old abandoned bandit hideouts, recall the
names of famous brigands.

**Opposition:** Hiding under optimal conditions (night, no moon,
inclement weather) is normally an automatic success. Such situations are
rare, however. Instead, most Prowl rolls are Easy (3D6) under ordinary
circumstances. Increase the standard difficulty by one step for each of
the following conditions: tracked by animals, bright sunlight, lack of
cover, quiet location.

:::::::::::::::: success :::::::::::::
| Prowl        |                     |
| :----------- | :------------------ |
| Time         | 1 action            |
| Opposition   | Standard Opposition |
| [+]          | Hide                |
| [+]          | Lead the Ambush     |
| [+][+]       | Increase Advantage  |
| [+][+][+]    | Gain 1 Style Point  |
| [+][+][+][+] | Move Undetected     |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Hide:** You find a place to hide until the end of the scene or you
move to a different location, whichever comes first. In order to see
you, someone else must make an Observation roll against a standard
difficulty of Easy (3D6). For every two additional success points you
spend, you increase the difficulty by one step, limited by your ranks in
Nature (Prowl):

Table: Maximum Observation Opposition

| Prowl Rank | Item Die              |
| :--------: | :-------------------: |
| 1          | Easy (3D6)            |
| 2          | Moderate (3D8)        |
| 3          | Difficult (3D10)      |
| 4          | Very Difficult (3D12) |
| 5          | Very Difficult (3D12) |

**Lead the Ambush:** You can extend the effects of your Prowl roll to
one additional ally in the same Area as you for each Success Point you
spend on Lead the Ambush. This can include hiding, increasing advantage,
or moving undetected.

**Increase Advantage:** You gain a D6 Advantage Die if you don't already
have Advantage, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum
of D12.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Move Undetected:** You can take a free move to an adjacent Area and
remain unseen if you are already hidden.
