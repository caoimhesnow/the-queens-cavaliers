## Magicks ## {.cbreakbefore}

The world of Elara has very subtle forms of magicks: brewing draughts,
weaving charms into clothing, and reading portents. Most characters
completely lack knowledge in Magicks, leaving the study up to those who
specialize in it.

Successfully using a Magicks specialty results in the creation of a
Charm die. As with other types of dice, you can have only one Charm die
in any dice pool.

### Weave

*Verve Specialty*

Charmwoven clothing must be specifically created for each character
using the Weave specialty, as it involves knowledge of the wearer's
birthstone and other personal qualities.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate charmwoven items and identify their
charms, determine the specific master charmweaver who created an item of
apparel, recall facts related to the creation of cloth and silk.

**Crafting: **Articles of clothing, including charmwoven apparel<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection">Crafting</a>.

**Opposition:** Most Weave rolls are made to craft garments. Sensing or
restoring a charm is Easy (3D6) standard opposition. An attempt to
suppress a or bolster a Charm Die is made against standard opposition
corresponding to the size of the Charm Die -- Easy (3D6) for a +1D6
Charm Die, Moderate (3D8) for a +1D8 Charm Die, and so on.

| [+][+][+][+]   | Restore Charm Die             |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Sense Charm: **You can sense charms woven into clothing that are in
the same area as you, starting with the nearest charm to you. You learn
the article of clothing that's encharmed and which Specialty the Charm
Die applies to. If you spend another success point, you also learn the
size of the Charm Die. For each additional success point you spend, you
can sense another charm in your area or an adjacent area. You can choose
to skip over any charm created or worn by you.

**Suppress Charm Die: **You can choose one article of clothing in the
same area as you. If that article has a Charm Die, it is reduced by one
step. If it has a +1D6 Charm Die, you can remove it entirely. This
effect lasts until the end of the current scene. Each additional 2
success points you spend reduces the Charm Die by one step. You can
reduce a Charm Die as many steps as you have ranks in Magicks (Weave).

**Bolster Charm Die:** You can choose one article of clothing in the
same area as you. If that article has a Charm Die, it is increased by
one step until the end of the scene. You can only increase a Charm Die
by one step.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Restore Charm Die: **You can choose one article of clothing in the
same area as you. If that article has a Charm Die that has been
suppressed or temporarily removed, you can restore the Charm Die to its
normal value. Until the end of the scene, that article's Charm Die can't
be suppressed.

### Brew

*Affinity Specialty*

Brew is the magickal ability to distill enchantments into drinkable
draughts.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Identify a draught and its effects, recall the
names of the master alchemists in a city, describe where exotic
ingredients can be found.

**Crafting: **Salves, draughts, and other alchemical formulations<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection">Crafting</a>.

**Opposition:** Most Magicks (Brew) rolls are made to create a draught
or salve. Mixing a concoction has a standard difficulty of Easy (3D6). 

:::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::::::::::
| Brew           |                                |
| :------------- | :----------------------------- |
| Time           | 1 action                       |

| [+][+]         | Apply a Concoction             |
| [+][+][+]      | Gain 1 Style Point             |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Mix a Concoction:** You hastily mix together volatile chemicals and
reagents to produce an immediate reaction. You spend 1 unit of
alchemical ingredients and create one of the concoctions listed in
<a href="#concoctions" class="in-chapter-under"></a>. The concoction has an initial potency
level of 1 but increases by 1 for every 2 success points you spend. The
concoction lasts until your next turn, after which it becomes inert.

**Apply a Concoction:** You apply the effects of your concoction to
yourself, your area, an adjacent area, or another person in the same
area as you. Each recipient of the effect beyond the first requires that
you spend 1 additional unit of alchemical ingredients, with a limit of
additional targets equal to your specialty ranks in Magicks (Brew).

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

### Portents

*Guile Specialty*

The Portents specialty involves reading omens and signs as well as using
cards, dice, tea leaves, or astrological charts to determine someone's
future. It also includes placing hexes on people, and creating simple
trinkets known as bibelots that ward off hexes and bad luck.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Recall the names of famous seers or witches
throughout history, identify when someone is the target of a hex,
identify a bibelot's charm, remember the astrological signs and
birthstones.

**Crafting: **Astrological charts, bibelots, and divination tools<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection">Crafting</a>.

**Opposition:** If you read either the general omens around you or a
willing subject, the roll is an automatic success and the success points
determine the strength of the reading. If you are doing a reading on an
unwilling subject or if you are casting a hex on someone, the difficulty
is either Easy (3D6) or an opposed Magicks (Portents) roll, whichever is
better for the subject.

| [+][+][+][+]   | Cast a Hex                             |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Read Portents:** You make a general prediction about the next 24
hours. Ask one yes-or-no question, or have the person you're reading ask
a yes-or-no question. You receive an answer which creates a +1D0 Tag Die
connected to that answer. Until the prediction comes true or 24 hours
passes, the subject of the reading can choose to use the tag as a Bonus
Die on any rolls that relate to the answer proving true. Each use of the
Tag Die decreases its size by one die size, or ends the prediction if
it's a +1D0 Bonus Die. As long as any prediction is still in effect, the
subject can't be the recipient of another reading.

**Increase Accuracy:** The Tag Die increases by one die size, with a
limit set by your ranks in Magicks (Portents) as shown in the following
table:

Table: Maximum Tag Die

| Portents Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |
| :------------: | :-------------: |
|  +1            |  +1D0           |
|  +2            |  +1D6           |
|  +3            |  +1D8           |
|  +4            |  +1D10          |
|  +5            |  +1D12          |

**Increase Precision:** The duration of your prediction increases by 24
hours, up to a limit of increases equal to your Magicks (Portents)
ranks.

**Increase Specificity:** The subject of the reading can ask another
yes-or-no question and receive an answer, or ask a question that can be
answered with a single noun. This creates an additional +1D0 Tag Die
based on the new question, that otherwise functions like the first Tag
Die. The maximum number of additional questions is limited to the number
of Magicks (Portents) specialty ranks you have.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Cast a Hex:** You choose one skill and the subject of your reading
becomes cursed on rolls with that skill for the next 24 hours. If your
subject is wearing a bibelot for that skill, the hex immediately ends
and the bibelot is destroyed. Otherwise, any existing hexes on her end
and she gains a Drop 1 penalty on that skill and its specialties. Every
time the Drop penalty is applied to one of her rolls, it decreases by 1.
When the Drop penalty is reduced to 0, the hex ends. For every two
success points you spend, you can increase the initial size of the Drop
penalty by 1, with a limit determined by your ranks in Portents as shown
on the following table:

Table: Maximum Hex Penalty

| Portents Ranks | Maximum Hex Penalty |
| :------------: | :-----------------: |
|  +1            | Drop 1              |
|  +2            | Drop 2              |
|  +3            | Drop 3              |
|  +4            | Drop 4              |
|  +5            | Drop 4              |
