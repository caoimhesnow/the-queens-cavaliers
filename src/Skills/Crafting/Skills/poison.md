### Poison

You can craft poisons and antidotes with Medicine (Poison) specialty.

**Base Time:** Crafting poison or antidote takes 1 hour.

**Item Die:** Add the Item Die of your alchemy tools or laboratory to your dice pool.

**Supplies:** Alchemical ingredients are required for crafting poisons and antidotes.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Medicine (Poison).

**Extra Supplies:** You can use extra supplies while crafting to add a
Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your
number of ranks in Medicine (Poison).

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to craft your creation by taking a
Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking
extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
the crafting.

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically
succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the
creation.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Craft Standard Poison (1 unit of alchemical ingredients):** You create
one dose of a standard type of poison with an Item Die of +1D6. Standard
poisons are listed in Chapter 9, "Specialized Gear."

**Craft Antidote (1 unit of alchemical ingredients):** You create two
doses of poison antidote. The antidote gives a +1D6 Item Die on attempts
to cure poisons.

**Increase Quantity (1 unit of alchemical ingredients):** You make
another dose of poison or two doses of antidote for each success point
and unit of alchemical ingredients you spend. The Item Die of the
additional doses is the same as the original; you only need to increase
the potency, add a delay, or add a stage for one dose.

**Add Time Delay (1 unit of alchemical ingredients):** The poison
doesn't take effect until 1 hour after being introduced to the victim's
system for each success point and unit of alchemical ingredients you
spend. The maximum number of hours you can delay the effects is equal to
your ranks in Poison (Medicine)

**Add Stage (1 unit of alchemical ingredients):** You create a staged
poison -- the individual components are harmless but when all are
combined together the poison takes effect. Applications of the stages
must take place within an hour of the first stage, or the poison loses
all potency. The maximum number of stages you can create is equal to
your ranks in Poison (Medicine); if you just have +1 rank, you can't
create a staged poison.

**Improve Potency (1 unit of alchemical ingredients):** You increase the
Item Die of the poison or antidote by one die size. You are limited by
the number of specialty ranks you have in Poison (Medicine).

**Craft Exotic Poison (3 units of alchemical ingredients):** You create
one dose of a rare poison. The poison has an Item Die of +1D6, and it
can only be neutralized by a dose of exotic antidote created
specifically for this toxin.

**Craft Exotic Antidote (3 units of alchemical ingredients):** You
create one dose of an antidote formulated against a specific exotic
poison. The antidote has an Item Die of +1D6, and is only effective
against that single toxin.

**Develop Antidote (3 units of alchemical ingredients, 1 dose of the
poison in question or a poisoned victim):** You create one dose of an
antidote formulated against an unknown poison or unique poison. The
antidote has an Item Die of +1D6, and is only effective against that
single toxin. Now that you've created the cure, you can create it as an
"exotic antidote", as can anyone who you instruct in the process.

**Eureka\! (5 units of alchemical ingredients):** You've managed to mix
up a unique poison that is resistant to the normal antidotes. The
poison's Item Die is +1D6. Now that you have created it, you can create
it as an "exotic poison", as can anyone who you instruct in the process.
In addition, you can also create an antidote to your own creation.
