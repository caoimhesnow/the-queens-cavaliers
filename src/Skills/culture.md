## Culture

The Culture skill includes arts, history, religion, language, mythology,
music, customs, traditions, noble families, and other societal elements
found in the cultures of Elara and Ifran.

The Culture specialties are often used as knowledge rolls.

### Arts

*Verve Specialty*

Sculpture, music, painting, poetry, sketching, woodcuts, writing, dance,
acting, and other forms of art are used to convey the core values of
Elaran society. The Arts specialty includes not just basic knowledge of
artwork, but also the ability to create works of art and to perform
creative works.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate a piece of art, spot a forgery, remember
the name of a famous artist, identify tools and instruments used in art
or music.

**Crafting:** Create works of art such as drawings, poetry, paintings,
sculptures, plays, songs, opera, novellas, and more, as described in
Chapter 10, "Crafting."

**Bonus Die:** If you are performing an existing work of art, such as a
musical composition or a play, you can include the work's Tag Die as a
Bonus Die.

**Opposition:** Under most situations, an Arts roll will automatically
succeed and the success points will determine the quality of the
performance. Under less than ideal circumstances, Standard Opposition of
Easy (3D6) or higher may be required.

appropriate. You can make one additional Tag with a +1D0 Bonus Die for
each success point you spend.

die size. You are limited by the number of skill ranks you have in

bonus if you commit a social faux pas or otherwise fail to act in
accordance with the airs you've put on.
