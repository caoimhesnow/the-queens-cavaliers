## Dueling ## {.breakbefore}

The Dueling skill lets you make attacks using a dueling weapon, such as
a sword, a knife, a quarterstaff, or even a pike.

**Wounds:** Dueling rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your
Wounds.

### Lunge

*Verve Specialty*

A Lunge is a basic attack and can be attempted with any hand-held
weapon, and is the most common way of dealing damage to an opponent in a
close-up fight. It can be opposed by any Defense specialty.

**Wounds:** Lunge rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate a dueling weapon's quality, remember the
names of famous duelists, identify the national origin of someone's
fencing style.

**Crafting:** Swords and polearms<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Opposition:** A Lunge can be defended against with any Defense roll.

**Inflict 1 Yield:** Your opponent takes one Yield for each Success
Point you spend on Yield. If her Yield equals or exceeds her Yield
Limit, she is Yielded Out.

already have Advantage, or increase your die size by one step, up to a
maximum of +1D12.

you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Inflict 1 Wound:** Your opponent takes one Wound. If she takes more
Wounds than her Wound Limit (which is four for player characters, and
from one to four for non-player characters), she falls unconscious and
is dying.

**Break Weapon:** You snap your target's blade. You can only do this if
your target attempts to Parry your attack and fails. A broken weapon is
useless except as an improvised weapon.

### Riposte

*Affinity Specialty*

A Riposte is a counterattack that can only be attempted after a
successful Parry or Feint. By catching your opponent off-guard, you can
slip past her normal defenses.

**Wounds:** Riposte rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your
Wounds.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate a Dueling weapon's quality, remember the
names of famous duelists, identify the national origin of someone's
fencing style.

**Crafting:** Daggers and other knives<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Opposition:** A Riposte can only be defended against by a Block or
Dodge roll, and not by a Parry roll.

you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

### Feint

*Guile Specialty*

A Feint is a false attack designed to get your opponent to lower her
defenses. The primary advantage of a Feint is to build Advantage against
your opponent; you can't usually inflict Wounds directly with a Feint,
although you can inflict Yield.

**Wounds:** Feint rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate a Dueling weapon's quality, remember the
names of famous duelists, identify the national origin of someone's
fencing style.

Dodge roll, but not by a Block roll.

Feint.

Parry you. You get to choose if the weapon ends up on the ground in your
Area, in an adjacent Area, or in your hand if you have one free.
