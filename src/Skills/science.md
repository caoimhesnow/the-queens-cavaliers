## Science ## {.cbreakbefore}

Science is a skill that covers the use, repair, and creation of advanced
technology and complex mathematics, from time watches to airships, from
repeating cannons to wing-gliders. The Blackpowder specialty also covers
the use of explosives.

### Blackpowder

*Verve Specialty*

The Blackpowder specialty is used to work with explosives of all types,
as well as the rare phlogistone material that allows airships to soar
through the sky. Skilled powderworkers are employed by militaries, by
craftsmen, and by airship crews.

A Blackpowder roll is used to fire cannons and throw grenades, which
cause explosive damage to all within a given Area or to structures such
as buildings or ships. Although pistols and muskets use blackpowder to
fire their ammunition, the Military (Aim) skill is used for those
hand-held weapons.

**Explosion Damage:** An explosion weapon does damage to everything
inside a given Area. More powerful explosions also do damage in adjacent
Areas, and even targets up to two Areas away for the most powerful
explosions.

The person who initiated the explosion makes a Blackpowder roll as an
automatic success to set the base damage and the range.

Anyone in an area affected by the explosion makes a Block or Dodge roll
that also is an automatic success. For one success point on the Block or
Dodge roll, a target gains one less point of Yield, and for three
successes she takes one less Wound.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate the quality of a cannon or grenade,
describe the process used to create blackpowder or phlogistone,
remember, remember the 5th of Frimaire.

**Crafting:** Phlogistone furnaces, cannons, grenades, fireworks, and
other uses of blackpowder.

**Wounds: **Blackpower rolls with explosive weapons are subject to Drop
penalties from your Wounds.

**Time:** Firing a loaded weapon or detonating charges takes one action.
Setting or disarming explosives takes one minute. 

**Item Die:** Add the Weapon Die as an Item Die when using an explosive
weapon, or the Item Die of repair tools if setting, disarming, or
detonating explosives.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time setting or disarming a bomb to
add a Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by
your number of ranks in Science (Blackpowder), as shown on the following
table:

Table: Extra Time for a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Bonus Die | Blackpowder Rank Required |
| :-------------: | :-------: | :-----------------------: |
| 2 minutes       | 1D0       |  +1                       |
| 5 minutes       | 1D6       |  +2                       |
| 15 minutes      | 1D8       |  +3                       |
| 1 hour          | 1D10      |  +4                       |
| 4 hours         | 1D12      |  +5                       |

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to set or disarm a bomb by taking a
Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking
extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
the task, as shown on the following table:

Table: Rushing a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| :-------------: | :----------: |
| 45 seconds      | Drop 1       |
| 30 seconds      | Drop 2       |
| 2 actions       | Drop 3       |
| 1 action        | Drop 4       |

**Opposition:** When using an explosive weapon or detonating charges,
the Blackpowder roll is an automatic success and the success points are
used to select a target area and set the base damage of the explosion.
For setting or disarming explosives, the standard opposition is based on
the bomb's Explosion Dice.

::::::::::::::::: success :::::::::::::::::::::

| [+][+][+]     | Gain 1 Style Point          |
| [+][+][+][+]  | Disarm Explosives           |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Hit An Area:** You fire an explosive weapon into an area adjacent to
your own. For each additional success point you spend, you can move the
center of the explosion another area away from you, out to the maximum
range of the weapon.

**Base Damage +1 Wound:** For every two success points you spend,
increase the base damage by 1 Wound. This increase to the Wound damage
is limited to twice the number of ranks you have in Science
(Blackpowder).

**Set Timed Fuse:** You set a timed fuse in your area to detonate within
a given period of time. The default fuse for a standard bomb is one to
10 rounds, with the exact number of rounds being up to you. The bomb
detonates at the end of the chosen round, after everyone else has acted.

**Detonate Charges:** You immediately detonate a bomb in your own area
or an adjacent area. Alternately, you can use a Pistol or Musket within
its normal range or a thrown flame within Short range (1 to 2 Areas) to
perform this action. Add the Pistol or Musket's Weapon Die as an Item
Die, and apply any Drop Penalties due to the weapon's normal range.

**Expand Radius: **When setting explosives or firing artillery, you can
extend the radius of the blast by one step. "Close" becomes "Adjacent",
"Adjacent" becomes "Short", and so on, out to the maximum radius of the
explosives.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Disarm Explosives:** You disarm a bomb or other explosive device that
has not yet detonated.

### Clockworks

*Affinity Specialty*

The Clockworks specialty allows you to create, repair, and customize
clockwork devices. For more details, see the list of clockwork devices
and components <a href="#clockworks-2" class="xref-inchapter-under">Clockworks</a>.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Identify the functions and components of a
clockwork device, recall the names of famous mechanicians, determine
what components of a device are malfunctioning, read and understand
plans drawn by other clockworkers.

**Crafting: **Clockwork devices, components, power sources, and other
mechanical contrivances<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection">Crafting</a>.

**Time: **It takes one action to keep a device together or draw more
power from it. Sabotaging a device takes 1 minute. To repair a device or
salvage components from it takes 1 hour.

**Bonus Die:** If you have plans for the device you're working on, you
can add the bonus die from those plans to the roll, in addition to any
applicable Item Die.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time repairing, salving, or
sabotaging a device to add a Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of
that die is limited by your number of ranks in Science (Clockworks), as
shown on the following tables:

Table: Extra Time for a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Bonus Die | Clockworks Rank Required |
| :-------------: | :-------: | :----------------------: |
| 2 minutes       | 1D0       |  +1                      |

| 32 hours (4 days) | 1D12      |  +5                      |

**Rushing: **You can reduce the time to repair, salvage, or sabotage a
device by taking a Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job
that you're taking extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends
on how much you rush the task, as shown on the following table:

Table: Rushing a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| :-------------: | :----------: |
| 45 seconds      | Drop 1       |
| 30 seconds      | Drop 2       |
| 2 actions       | Drop 3       |
| 1 action        | Drop 4       |

Table: Rushing a One-Hour Task

| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| :-------------: | :----------: |
| 30 minutes      | Drop 1       |
| 15 minutes      | Drop 2       |
| 5 minutes       | Drop 3       |
| 1 minute        | Drop 4       |

**Opposition:** The standard opposition for working with a clockwork
device is normally Easy (3D6). If you created or assembled the device
yourself, the roll is an automatic success and the success points are
used to determine how well you accomplished the task. For each component
in a device that is beyond your ability to create, based on your Science
(Clockworks) skill, increase the standard opposition by one step.

::::::::::::::::: success :::::::::::::::::::::::
| Clockworks    |                               |
| :------------ | :---------------------------- |
| Time          | 1 action, 1 minute, or 1 hour |
| Opposition    | Standard Opposition           |
| Item Die      | Tools or Workshop Die         |
| Bonus Die     | Plans, extra time             |
| [+]           | Keep It Together              |
| [+][+]        | We Need More Power            |
| [+][+]        | Repair 1 Malfunction          |
| [+][+]        | Salvage a Component           |
| [+][+][+]     | Gain 1 Style Point            |
| [+][+][+][+]  | Sabotage Device               |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Keep It Together:** You manage to patch the device together long
enough that one malfunction doesn't affect it until the end of the next
round. For each additional success point, you increase the duration by
another round.

**We Need More Power: **You manage to coax an extra point of power out
of a device's power source for every two success points you spend, with
a limit of extra power equal to your ranks in Science (Clockworks). The
increased power lasts until you spend it or the end of the next round.
At the end of the scene, the device gains one malfunction for every time
you boosted the power output.

**Repair 1 Malfunction:** You fix the device and remove a malfunction in
one of its components. Each malfunction removed requires the expenditure
of one unit of supplies of a type used to create the component.

**Salvage a Component:** You can remove one functioning component or
power source from the device, for use in later devices; this requires at
least an hour's worth of work. You can't salvage a malfunctioning or
destroyed component. Alternately, you can destroy a component or power
source to regain one unit of supplies of a type used to create the
component.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Sabotage Machine:** You add a malfunction to one component in a
device. If you spend an extra success point, you can remove the
malfunction later by taking a single action to do so.

### Calculus

*Guile Specialty*

The Calculus specialty includes all manner of calculations of numbers,
from adding sums to deriving mathematical equations. Experienced
merchants and moneylenders also use Calculus regularly in order to
balance their books, and mariners use Calculus to create their charts.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Read and understand the meaning behind complex
equations, recall the names of famous mathematicians and scientists.

**Crafting:** Calculations, clockwork plans, and mathematical theorems<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection">Crafting</a>.

**Opposition:** Use Easy (3D6) for calculations done in a well-equipped
workshop, or Moderate (3D8) for field work with paper and ink. Doing
calculations in your head is Hard (3D10).

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Simple Calculation:** You perform a simple calculation such as
determining the size or speed of an object. 

**Analytics:** You create a +1D0 Tag Die based one specialty that can be
used as a Bonus Die until the end of the scene. The Tag Die can only be
used in a roll that uses quantities, measurements, prices, or other
numbers. Examples include navigating with Nature (Explore), cooking food
with Nature (Husbandry), haggling over a price with Interaction
(Negotiate), or aiming a cannon with Science (Blackpowder). For every
two additional success points you spend, you can increase the Tag Die by
one size, with a limit based on your ranks in Science (Calculus) as
shown in the following table:

Table: Maximum Tag Die

| Calculus Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |
| :------------: | :-------------: |
|  +1            |  +1D0           |
