# Medicine ## {.breakbefore}

Medical science is relatively advanced in Elara, thanks to both a long
history of witch-midwives and alchemy, and recent advances in science.
The Medicine skill is used to treat minor injuries, perform major
surgery, and work safely with poisonous toxins.

## Surgery

*Verve Specialty*

Surgery is a Specialty which can be used to heal injuries which are
resistant to the Treat specialty, as well as to perform other surgical
procedures.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Perform an autopsy to determine the cause of death,
recall the names of famous surgeons, diagnose a patient in need of
surgery.

**Wounds:** Apply the patient's wounds as a Drop Penalty on your surgery
roll.

**Supplies:** The Surgery specialty uses medicine.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on a surgical procedure to add
a Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your
number of ranks in Medicine (Surgery), as shown on the following table:

Table: Extra Time for a One-Hour Task

| Completion Time   | Bonus Die | Specialty Rank Required |
| :---------------: | :-------: | :---------------------: |
| 2 hours           | 1D0       |  +1                     |
| 4 hours           | 1D6       |  +2                     |
| 8 hours (1 day)   | 1D8       |  +3                     |
| 16 hours (2 days) | 1D10      |  +4                     |
| 32 hours (4 days) | 1D12      |  +5                     |

**Extra Supplies: **You can use extra medicine during surgery to add a
Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your
number of ranks in Medicine (Surgery), as shown on the following tables:

Table: Extra Supplies

| Units of medicine | Bonus Die | Specialty Rank Required |
| :---------------: | :-------: | :---------------------: |
| 2                 | 1D0       |  +1                     |
| 3                 | 1D6       |  +2                     |
| 4                 | 1D8       |  +3                     |
| 6                 | 1D10      |  +4                     |
| 8                 | 1D12      |  +5                     |

**Opposition:** Healing wounds or minor surgeries are Easy (3D6)
standard difficulty. Major surgeries are Moderate (3D8) or higher.

| [+][+][+][+][+] | Major Surgical Procedure                 |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Patient Survives:** Despite the relatively advanced state of Elaran
medicine, surgery remains a risky proposition. If you don't spend one
Success Point to ensure the life of the patient, the patient takes one
Wound.

**Heal 1 Wound:** The patient heals one Wound. This requires that you
spend 1 unit of medicine per wound healed.

**Minor Surgical Procedure:** You perform a minor surgical procedure,
such as suturing a wound or the setting of a bone. The patient must rest
for 1 day or else gain one Wound the first time she engages in physical
activity. A minor procedure expends 2 units of medicine.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Major Surgical Procedure:** You perform a major surgical procedure,
such as a Caesarian section, gender confirmation surgery, or removal of
the appendix. The patient must rest for 1 week (six days) or else gain
one Wound the first time each day that she engages in physical activity.
A major procedure expends 5 units of medicine.

## Treat

*Affinity Specialty*

The Treat specialty is used to care for those who are injured or sick.
After a Wound is taken, only one Treat roll can be made; further Wounds
must be healed using the Surgery specialty.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Diagnose a patient as suffering from poison or
disease, determine the cause of an injury, recall facts about a known
illness and useful folk cures for the same.

**Crafting:** Cures for diseases and other medical supplies<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Base Time:** Treating a wound or removing Yield takes one minute, and
treating diseases or applying cures takes one hour.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on treatment to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Medicine (Surgery), as shown on the following table:

Table: Extra Time for a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Bonus Die | Treat Rank Required |
| :-------------: | :-------: | :-----------------: |
| 2 minutes       | 1D0       |  +1                 |
| 5 minutes       | 1D6       |  +2                 |

| 32 hours (4 days) | 1D12      |  +5                 |

**Extra Supplies: **You can use extra medicine during treatment to add a
Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your
number of ranks in Medicine (Surgery), as shown on the following tables:

Table: Extra Supplies

| Units of medicine | Bonus Die | Specialty Rank Required |
| :---------------: | :-------: | :---------------------: |
| 2                 | 1D0       |  +1                     |
| 3                 | 1D6       |  +2                     |
| 4                 | 1D8       |  +3                     |
| 6                 | 1D10      |  +4                     |
| 8                 | 1D12      |  +5                     |

**Rushing: **You can reduce the time to treat a patient by taking a Drop
penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking extra
time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
treatment, as shown on the following tables:

Table: Rushing a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| :-------------: | :----------: |
| 45 seconds      | Drop 1       |
| 30 seconds      | Drop 2       |
| 2 actions       | Drop 3       |
| 1 action        | Drop 4       |

Table: Rushing a One-Hour Task

| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| :-------------: | :----------: |
| 30 minutes      | Drop 1       |
| 15 minutes      | Drop 2       |
| 5 minutes       | Drop 3       |
| 1 minute        | Drop 4       |

**Opposition:** The opposition depends on the severity of the condition
being treated. Reducing Yield is an automatic success, with the number
of success points determining how many points of Yield are removed.
Treating wounds is Easy (3D6), and treating a disease is dependent upon
the severity of the disease.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Reduce Patient's Yield:** If someone in the same area as you has taken
Yield, you can remove one point of Yield per success point you spend.
This expends one unit of medicine, regardless of how many success points
you spend.

**Heal 1 Wound:** The patient heals one Wound that has been sustained in
the last hour. This consumes one unit of medicine for each Wound healed,
and requires one minute of time.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Heal 1 Wound:** The patient heals one Wound that has been sustained in
the last hour. This consumes one unit of medicine for each Wound healed,
and requires one minute of time.

**Reduce Disease Severity:** The disease progresses to the next entry on the Illness Track, 
or regresses to the previous entry. If the disease moves off the Illness Track, it is
eliminated.  This consumes one unit of medicine for each entry moved on the Illness Track.

:# Diseases

Every disease in *The Queen's Cavaliers* has a table that's called an **Illness Track**. This displays the
normal course of the disease over a period of several days -- or, sometimes, hours -- and shows the increase
or decrease of the symptoms over time. At the start of each time period after infection occurs, the patient makes
a special Medicine (Treat) roll against the severity of the disease, representing her body's natural ability
to fight off disease.

If the patient succeeds on the Treat roll, she can spend her success points on the following
success table.

::::::::::::::::::::::::: success :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
| Treat                 | Recovery                                      |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Time                  | Free roll, once per time period               |
| Opposition            | Standard Opposition, based on illness track   |
| [+]                   | Arrest Progress                               |
| [+][+][+][+]          | Reduce Severity                               |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Arrest Progress:** The disease does not progress to the next step on the Illness Track.
**Reduce Severity:** The disease progresses to the next entry on the Illness Track, 
or regresses to the previous entry. If the disease moves off the Illness Track, it is
eliminated.

If the patient fails on the Treat roll, the MJ can spend the disease's success points on
the following success table. Italicized results can only be chosen if the result appears
on the current symptoms on the Illness Track.

**Disease Progression:** The disease advances to the next entry on the Illness Track. Each additional
three success points spent advances the disease an additional entry.
**Reduce Yield Limit (Symptom):** The patient's yield limit is reduced by 1 until the next Disease roll.
**Drop Penalty (Symptom):** The patient takes a Drop 1 penalty on all rolls until the next Disease roll. Each
additional two success points spent increases this penalty by 1, to a maximum of Drop 4.
**Linger:** The disease does not progress to the next entry on the Illness Track.
**Relapse:** The disease regresses to the previosu entry on the Illness Track.
**Inflict 1 Wound (Symptom):** The patient takes 1 wound.
**Complications (Symptom):** The patient receives a complication as described for the disease.
**Death (Symptom):** The patient dies.

The following table describes *la grippe*, a disease with flu-like symptoms.

## Poison

*Guile Specialty*

The Poison specialty covers the creation, application, and use of
various toxic substances as well as antidotes for the same. A target can
be poisoned directly, or poison can be applied to a weapon.

**Standard Poisons:** The following types poisons are commonly used
throughout Elara and Ifran: deadly poison, impairing poison, and sleep
poison. See <a href="#poison" class="xref-inchapter-under"></a> for more details.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Identify a poison without being exposed to it,
diagnose someone suffering from poison based on the effects, determine
whether or not an item of food is safe to consume.

**Crafting:** Poisons and antidotes<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Opposition:** Applying poison to your own weapon is an automatic
success, with the number of success points determining how many times
you can use that application of poison. Directly administering poison to
your victim is opposed by her Brawl roll. Adding poison to food or drink
is opposed by the highest Observation of whoever might be able to spot
you doing the deed. Administering an antidote is based on the potency of
the poison.

| [+][+][+]      | Gain 1 Style Point                        |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Poisoned Weapon:** You can add expend one dose of poison and apply it
to a Knife, Sword, Polearm, or the arrows for a Bow. For each success
point you spend, you can use the poison's success table on one attack,
in addition to the normal success table for your weapon and attack. Your
weapon ceases to be poisoned when you make a number of attacks equal to
the success points you spent, when you apply a different poison to the
weapon, or at the end of the current scene.

**Poison Your Victim:** You can use your Success Points to directly
injure or debilitate the target by expending one dose of poison. Each
additional success point you spend can be used on the poison's success
table against your victim.

**Administer Antidote:** You administer an antidote to someone who has
been poisoned, expending one dose of antidote. For every two success
points you spend, you can reduce the potency of the poison, reduce the
duration of the poison, remove 2 Yield inflicted by the poison, or heal
1 Wound inflicted by poison during the current scene.

**Avoid Notice:** You apply your poison surreptitiously, hoping to go
unseen. The opposition for an Observation roll to spot the poison --
either on your blade, in a drink, or in food -- is Easy (3D6). For every
two additional success points, you can increase the difficulty to spot
the posion by one step, limited by your specialty ranks in Medicine
(Poison) as shown in the following table:

Table: Maximum Observation Opposition

| Poison Rank | Item Die              |
| :---------: | :-------------------: |
| 1           | Easy (3D6)            |
| 2           | Moderate (3D8)        |
| 3           | Difficult (3D10)      |
| 4           | Very Difficult (3D12) |
| 5           | Very Difficult (3D12) |

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.
