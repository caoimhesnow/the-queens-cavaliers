## Generic Success Tables ## 

The following Success Tables can be used in lieu of, or in addition to,
the specific Success Tables for each Specialty. The results should be
used loosely and with discretion, as some results might not be justified
based on the fictional context.

### Non-Combat Skills in Combat

This table can be used to represent Skills which aren't normally
intended for a fight (i.e., not Defense, Dueling, Aim, or Brawl) but
which end up being used anyway. For example, a Mechanician might attempt
to overload one of her devices or a Virtuosa could sing loud enough to
shatter glass.

**Opposition:** The opposition dice can be anywhere from Easy (3D6) to
Very Difficult (3D12) depending on the MJ's assessment of the situation.
Alternately, the target can defend with an appropriate Defense
specialty, if the MJ decides the Skill use is similar to an attack.

::::::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
| Any Skill         |                                            |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| Time:             | 1 action                                   |
| Opposition        | Standard Opposition or Applicable Defense  |
| [+][+]            | Inflict 1 Yield                            |
| [+][+][+]         | Reduce Yield Taken                         |
| [+][+][+]         | Increase Advantage                         |
| [+][+][+]         | Gain 1 Style Point                         |
| [+][+][+][+][+]   | Inflict 1 Wound                            |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Inflict 1 Yield:** Your opponent takes one Yield for every two Success
Points you spend on Yield. If her Yield equals or exceeds her Yield
Limit, she is Yielded Out. 

**Reduce Yield Taken:** If you have taken Yield, you can reduce it by
spending three Success Points per point of Yield.

**Increase Advantage:** You gain a D6 Advantage Die if you don't already
have Advantage, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum
of D12.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Inflict 1 Wound:** Your opponent takes one Wound. If she takes more
Wounds than her Wound Limit (which is four for player characters, and
from one to four for non-player characters), she falls unconscious and
is dying.

### Knowledge Rolls

Use this table for general knowledge rolls â€“ for example, if a character
with ranks in Science (Clockworks) is trying to recall the name of a
famous Mechanician or a Chirurgeon is remembering the facts about a
disease. Each Specialty has one or more examples of knowledge rolls that
can be made with that Specialty, although the lists are not exhaustive.
MJs and players should be creative in how they use Specialties to make
knowledge rolls.

**Opposition:** Characters automatically succeed on Knowledge checks, and
the success points generated indicate how much information they're able
to recall.

::::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::::::
| Knowledge       |                            | 
| :-------------- | :------------------------- |
| Time            | Free Roll                  |
| Opposition      | Automatic Success          |
| [+]             | Recall Common Knowledge    |
| [+][+]          | Recall Uncommon Knowledge  |
| [+][+][+][+]    | Recall Rare Knowledge      |
| [+][+][+][+][+] | Recall Unique Knowledge    |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Recall Common Knowledge:** You can recall basic facts about the topic,
enough to hold a simple conversation about it.

**Recall Uncommon Knowledge:** You are aware of some things that aren't
common knowledge about the subject.

**Recall Rare Knowledge:** You know something about the subject that
only comes from deeper study or experience.

**Recall Unique Knowledge:** You have firsthand knowledge of something
about the topic that only a few others share.

### Standard Opposition Results

These results can be used by the MJ when a player's roll against
Standard Opposition dice fails. As with other generic result tables,
these should be used with discretion, as not all results will fit the
fictional circumstances.

**Opposition:** Standard Opposition is only rolled in response to an
action taken by a player character. If the Standard Opposition roll
beats the action's roll, the MJ may spend the Success Points on this
table, as well as declaring the action invalidated.

::::::::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::::
| Standard Opposition |                          |
| :------------------ | :----------------------- |
| Time                | Free Roll                |
| Opposition          | Specific Specialty Used  |
| [+]                 | Increase Difficulty      |
| [+][+]              | Inflict 1 Yield          |
| [+][+]              | Increase Tension         |
| [+][+]              | Mysterious Omen          |
| [+][+]              | Delayed Gratification    |
| [+][+][+]           | Grant 1 Style Point      |
| [+][+][+]           | Rude Interruption        |
| [+][+][+][+]        | Unnecessary Distraction  |
| [+][+][+][+]        | Challenge a Passion      |
| [+][+][+][+][+]     | Incredibly Bad Fortune   |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Increase Difficulty:** Step up one of the dice used in the roll, if
the player character (or an ally) attempts the same task. For example,
if the Standard Difficulty was Moderate (3D8), with one Success Point
you could step up one die, making it 1D10+2D8 on subsequent attempts. If
you spend three Success Points, step up all three of the dice.

**Inflict 1 Yield:** If the player character is attempting something
physically, mentally, or emotionally taxing, you can choose to inflict
Yield on her. Each additional two Success Points inflicts an extra point
of Yield.

**Increase Tension:** You gain a D6 Tension Die if you don't already
have Tension, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum of
D12. Describe how the tension in the current situation increases based
on the player character's failure at the task.

**Mysterious Omen:** Something ominous happens, perhaps foreshadowing a
future event. Players can attempt a Portents roll if they wish to try to
interpret the omen.

**Delayed Gratification:** The player character (or an ally) cannot make
another attempt at the same task until a certain amount of time has
passed. If the task normally takes one round, she must wait for a
minute; if a minute, then for an hour; if an hour, then for four hours;
if four hours, then for a day.

**Grant 1 Style Point:** Assign a Style Point to one of your non-player
characters, usually a Minor or Major Opponent. Minor Opponents can have
up to three Style Points, Major Opponents can have up to six Style
Points, and other characters can have only one Style Point.

**Rude Interruption:** The player character fails to complete her task
because someone rudely barges in, interrupting her. Choose one of your
existing NPCs or create a new character to intrude on the character;
this could even be a hostile opponent, although not a Major Opponent.
She won't be able to resume her task until she manages to send away the
intruder.

**Unnecessary Distraction:** An event happens nearby that distracts the
player character, causing her to fail on her attempt. This could be a
loud noise outside, a sudden wind blowing around some papers, a horse
that decides to bolt, or an attractive person passing by. If the player
character (or an ally) attempts the task again, she gets a Drop 2
penalty on the roll.

**Challenge a Passion:** Choose one of the player character's Passions,
and a way in which it becomes challenged. Perhaps the Personification of
the Passion appears (as an NPC), or the player character remembers
something about that Personification (if not able to appear in person).
Maybe the situation changes so that the player character has to choose
between her values and succeeding at the task. Be creative\! The game
result is that if the player character attempts the task again, add her
Passion Die to the Standard Opposition dice on subsequent tries.

**Incredibly Bad Fortune:** Something goes disastrously wrong. A ship at
sea gets lost, a device being created explodes, a gun misfires, the
guards show up at the wrong moment, or the player character trips and
falls in front of an audience. The exact details are up to you, but they
should be serious without being directly deadly and possibly very
embarrassing. The player character can attempt the task again one she
recovers from the effects of her terrible luck.
