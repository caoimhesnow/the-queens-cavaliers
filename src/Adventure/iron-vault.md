# Secret of the Iron Vault

## Introduction

This is an introductory adventure for three to six beginning *TQC*
characters with D6 Competency Dice.

### Backstory

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: boxtext :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
The Iron Vault is located below the Citadel of the Queen's Cavaliers, in
a secure sub-basement level known only to a few. This is where the
Cavaliers have stored important documents, trophies of past adventures,
and valuable curiosities for nearly a century.

Last year, a group of Cavaliers defeated a smuggler captain and took her
ship as a prize – her ship in a bottle, that is. The ship, a model of
the pirate ship Peregrine, is stored in the Iron Vault.

Tucked inside the miniature hold of the Peregrine is an encoded document
that MACGUFFIN MACGUFFIN MACGUFFIN MACGUFFIN. Only a few know of the
existence of this letter, and only one – the Duke of Bedyngford – is
aware of its location within the Iron Vault.

Bedyngford learned of the Peregrine when Prince-Consort Carolus,
honorary head of the Queen's Cavaliers, mentioned it to to his
countryman while out on one of their regular drinking nights. Bedyngford
is determined to gain access to the Peregrine and the secret it
contains, and he has concocted an intricate plan to not only allow him
to seize it, but also discredit the Queen's Cavaliers.

## Running the Adventure

[]{.comingsoon}

## Player Introduction

Read or paraphrase the following information to the players:

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: boxtext :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Anticipation has been building for the last month. As new recruits to the
Queen's Cavaliers, you're officially being inducted into the organization
tomorrow. This honor is bestowed for your heroic service to the crown.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

You can change the background to fit the circumstances of your player
characters' backgrounds. Maybe they're not new recruits, but they're
members of the Cavaliers already, and are being recognized with an award or
medal -- the Cavaliers like giving out medals. Maybe one of the player
characters is a new recruit and the rest are veteran members.

The general idea is that there's something important happening the next day
that involves the player characters at the Citadel, the home base for the
Queen's Cavaliers. You should adapt this to fit the players.
