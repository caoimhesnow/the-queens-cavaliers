# Bodies of Water {.cbreakbefore}

Gallinea is a large peninsula, surrounded by water on three sides. In addition, rivers play a major
role in travel and trade.

## The Great Sea

The largest body of water near Gallinea is the **Great Sea,** often known by its Ekalian name of Oceanus.
Located to the west of Elara, Oceanus is known to be rough and dangerous, with huge waves and strong
winds dissuading any sailors who dare venture further than the Storm Islands which act as a form of
breakwater for the mainland.

The **Bay of Gallinea** -- also called the Bay of Albia -- is located between those two neighboring
countries. During the Twenty Years' War, this bay was the site of many naval battles between
Albia and Gallinea, and the sea floor is said to be littered with shipwrecks and the skeletons of
the dead.

## The Middle Sea

A far safer ocean than Oceanus is the **Middle Sea,** which connects Gallinea with Ondala, Dragosa, Pitdah,
Ubar, and even the ruins of Qarta for those who would dare venture there. Relatively placid and safe, 
the Middle Sea is used extensively for commerce.

The far west part of the Middle Sea, just before it joins the Great Sea, is known as the **Ondalan Channel.** At the closest point, only about 15 leagues separates Gallinea from Ondala, making this a highly strategic passage to control. Most of Gallinea's wars with Ondala have been fought over the Ondalan Channel.

The **Sea of Ekalia** is located between Gallinea and Dragosa, and in fact contains all the islands of Ekalia.  There are large fishing fleets working the sound, many of which tether together against huge barges to form ad hoc "cities" on artificial "islands."

At the far end of the Middle Sea from Gallinea lies the **Eastern Sea**, which is the oceanic gateway to the Coffee Coast, Serica, and lands beyond.

## Rivers

![Luisante River](assets/Maps/Thumb/luisante-river.jpg "Luisante River")
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The largest river in Gallinea is the **Luisante**, which flows from headwaters in the north through Lutetia
and finally empties in the Middle Sea in Valerienne, a journey of over 400 leagues. The river is slow
and wide, making travel between the Jeweled Coast and Coeur de Gallinea easy and efficient. Only
above Lutetia does the Luisante take on the sparkling clarity for which it's named, with the rest of
its length being a muddy brown. 

Luisante is so significant to Gallinean culture that if one says simply "The River," it's understood to 
be a reference to the Luisante. The Luisante is known as the jewel river, not because of its appearance, 
but beacuse of its importance in the trade of Gallinea with its northern neighbor Varendia and the 
outlet to Ondala on the Middle Sea.

The **Lente** is a major tributory of the Luisante, originating in the Lendine mountains from which it takes its name.  The slowest moving and most shallow of all the Gallinean rivers, it often appears not to move at all.  The sluggish pace of the river is often compared to the slower, less complicated country life of the agricultural provinces through which it flows.

The **Boueuse** also feeds into the Luisante, meandering through the farms and villages of the Lowlands.  The river seperates the Lowland forests and the Southern mountain range.  The Boueuse has the most lakes along its length even though it is also the shortest of all the major Gallinean rivers.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The **Canard,** in the northern Jeweled Coast, is often called a site for questionable trade.  This is not any more true of the Canard than any other Gallinean river, but as Ekalian sailors are often found here and are of a usually dubious nature, the reputation sticks.

The largest western river is the **Verte,** which flows into the Great Sea at Verterre. It has two major branches,
both of which are known as the Verte. The **North Verte** river is primarily used for logging in the
forests of the northern Lowlands, and the **South Verte** for transporting food from the farms of the
middle Lowlands. The Verte is nicknamed named the Green River for the abundant greenery crowding its banks.

The usual speed for a riverboat is 1 league per hour. However, each river in Gallinea travels at a different 
speed and that water speed, coupled with the width of
the river and the navigation conditions, will affect any riverboat traveling on it. The following table lists
each major river and its effects on river travel; daily speeds are given in Lpd            .

## Lakes

Gallinea has a number of smaller lakes but no truly large ones, although some of the Scanbrian lakes
in the north are of decent size. The most well-known lake is **Lac Luisante,** upon which the city of 
Lutetia was built.
