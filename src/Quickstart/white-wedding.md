## Nice Day for a White Wedding ## {.breakbefore}

This is a sample adventure that can be used by starting players and MJs to
introduce the world and the game rules.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: toolbox :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
**Summary:** In the high mountains of Varendia, a small group of Cavaliers
must prevent a kidnapping and save a marriage. This demo is designed for
two to six players and is designed to show both social skill use and a
thrilling combat.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Briefing

Read or summarize the following information:

:::::::::::::::::::: boxtext ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Piers de Montambre, the youngest son of Marquise Deina de Montambre, is
engaged to Hans von Stimmt, the youngest son of Landgraf Heinrich von
Stimmt. Both families approve of the marriage, which will further cement
ties between the two cities on opposite sides of the Lendine Mountains.

Landgraf von Stimmt is seeking allies in his conflicts with his fellow
Varendish lordlings, while Marquise Deina looks for new markets for
Montambre's iron and steel.

As the Marquise de Montambre is a strong supporter of Queen Mariana of
Gallinea, you have been sent to accompany her and Piers as honor guards
at the wedding and the reception that follows. The wedding will take
place in a chateau overlooking the von Stimmt lands.

Before you leave, a covert messenger sent by Prince Jean-Remy, the
Queen's spymaster, tells you that rumors are swirling that someone in
Varendia may be hiring mercenaries to disrupt the ceremony. The Landgraf
has dismissed those rumors as baseless, but you'd best be on your guard
anyway!
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Additional Background Details

You can summarize this information or provide it to your players if it
becomes necessary.

  - Varendia is a patchwork of small kingdoms and duchies who rarely
    manage to work together on much of anything, as they are busy
    jockeying for power and wealth in internal struggles.
  - Landgraf von Stimmt is currently vying for control over the
    Nebelwald, a large forest nestled against the Lendine Mountains. His
    chief rivals include Altgräfin Bridlin von Wolkenburg and Herzog
    Rein Bärenlied, neither of whom are present at the wedding.
  - Piers and Hans met while both were studying in Lutetia, the capital
    of Gallinea, and by all accounts are in love -- it's not just an
    arranged political marriage.
  - Montambre doesn't have any real enemies, but Marquise Deina is not
    on good terms with Comtesse Josette of the nearby town of
    Canard-Noir.

### The Wedding

Surprisingly, the wedding goes off without a hitch. It was a lovely
ceremony, performed by a Varendish priestess of Eserre, the sun
empress-goddess of the Asrian faith. The ceremony took place behind the
chateau in a picturesque meadow, and then the attendees moved inside for
the reception.

### The Reception

Now, this is where things begin to happen!

Lay out index cards as Areas to represent the sections of the ballroom
in the chateau where the reception is being held. The dancing floor
should be in the middle, and the balcony beside it, opposite the
entryway.

  - **The Grooms' Table:** Piers and Hans are seated here, along with
    Landgraf Heinrich, his wife Othilia, Marquise Deina, and her consort
    Esdeline Bissette. Attendees approach the table to offer their
    well-wishes to the happy couple, who are dressed in matching white
    formal outfits trimmed with their respective family colors (gold and
    brown for Montambre, green and brown for Stimmt). The nobles are
    getting along well with each other.
  - **Dining Tables:** This is where most of the people who attended the
    wedding are seated. Most of the people here are from Varendia,
    although some have traveled from Gallinea with the Cavaliers and the
    Marquise.
  - **Ballroom Floor:** An open space in the middle of the ballroom where
    the grooms can dance, as well as anyone else who feels like doing
    so.
  - **Chamber Ensemble:** There are six musicians sitting here, playing
    mostly Varendish songs with a few well-rehearsed Gallinean pieces as
    well. Cavaliers who are skilled at music may be asked to play a song
    with the ensemble.
  - **Balcony:** This is open to the chill spring air, overlooking the
    valley below the chateau. Stubborn patches of snow still cling to
    the nearby mountainsides, and far below the lights of a village,
    Stimmtburg, can be seen flickering in the darkness. The moon is full
    but partially hidden by the clouds of the night sky.
  - **Entryway:** There are two Varendish guards here, one man and one
    woman. They are tall, strong, silent, and completely humorless. They
    wear steel breastplates, iron helmets, and green/brown Stimmt
    tabards.

Ask the players where they are and place markers or tokens to represent
their locations on the index cards. Also place markers for the two
grooms, the Landgraf, the Marquise, and the two guards.

Allow the players to do whatever they want at the reception, and then
require a specialty roll to demonstrate how specialty rolls work. Here
are some examples of how you might resolve certain actions.

Interacting with nobles, including the grooms and their families, should
require a Culture (Etiquette) roll. Remember to add a cavalier's highest
social rank die to the roll as an item die. The standard opposition dice
are 3D8 for the groom's table, and 3D6 for any other guest.

To dance well, a cavalier will need to make a Culture (Arts) roll. The
standard opposition is Easy (3D6) unless the cavalier ends up in a
dance-off with someone. A cavalier who is a musician and who has her
instrument with her may be asked to join the chamber ensemble.

Mingling with the crowd to get information or just find a companion for
the evening is a Streetwise (Carouse) roll, with standard opposition of
Easy (3D6) if the character speaks Varendish, and Moderate (3D8) if not.
Some rumors or secrets include:

  #. The Landgraf recently canceled an order of steel breastplates from Canard-Noir (true; common rumor, or uncommon secret) 
  #. Three of the serving staff were hired a month ago (true; rare rumor or uncommon secret) 
  #. Someone in Stimmtburg was asking about mercenaries a few weeks ago, which admittedly isn't all that uncommon for Varendia (true; common rumor, or rare secret) 
  #. The marquise's consort is actually a spy in the employ of Prince Jean-Remy (false; common rumor) 
  #. The musicians were chosen because of their repertoire of Gallinean belle danse music (false; rare rumor) 
  #. Hans broke off an engagement with a duke's daughter to marry Piers (false; common rumor)

Remember that rumors could be true or could be false, while secrets are
always true. You can provide additional rumors or secrets at your
discretion.

Looking around and generally being on guard can be any Observation
check, against Easy (3D6) standard opposition. Alternately, a Knowledge
roll with an appropriate skill could suffice as well. Some of the things
a cavalier might notice: 

  #. The cellist is not as good as the rest of the musicians, and missed a few notes here and there
  #. There are 8 different members of the serving staff who move around delivering food and drinks, and carrying off empty plates
  #. The guards did pause to eat some strudel given to them by some serving staff
  #. There is a cold breeze blowing over the balcony and the sky above is getting cloudier, blocking out some stars
  #. The marquise's consort, Esdeline, looks bored and her bearing marks her as a non-noble
  #. The wine is mostly imported from Gallinea and was brought by the marquise.

Not all of these observations are important. You can feel free to add
additional details from the information given in the adventure, or just
make things up.

Bribing the serving staff for information or favors requires a
Streetwise (Larceny) roll with standard opposition of Moderate (3D8),
but also add the cavalier's highest Social Rank die to the opposition --
they're more willing to talk to other members of lower ranks than to
nobles. Use Carousing results to determine what kind of information is
given. You can decide if the staff member being addressed is a normal
server or an infiltrator (see below), based on what will make for a more
interesting story.

Try to give each player the chance to make at least one roll, preferably
something they're good at. Encourage the purchase of style points, and
make sure each character gets a close-up scene whenever they gain a new
style point.

### The Action Begins!

At an appropriate time, start the action part of the scene. It may
happen because a cavalier spots something while investigating, or you
could just choose to have it happen once each player has had her
cavalier do something useful. You can also start this part by having
Piers and Hans take to the center of the ballroom for a dance.

By this time, the guards are getting sleepy and starting to slump
against the wall, an unspeakable breach of duty under most
circumstances. They've been poisoned and are taking a Drop 2 penalty on
all actions; the cavaliers will be the heroes today, not the guards.

Have the cavaliers make simple Observation rolls against Easy (3D6)
standard opposition to see if they notice what's going on before it
happens. Each cavalier who succeeds can take a Drop 1 action -- moving
to a different area or drawing her weapon, for example -- before the
fight begins.

For every cavalier present, there will be one infiltrator -- a mercenary
who has been hired to capture Hans and take him out to the balcony. For
example, with four cavaliers playing, there will be four infiltrators.

The cellist is an infiltrator, and if there are more than four
cavaliers, so is the oboe player. They draw swords and pistols from
their instrument cases, surprising the other musicians. Represent these
with the Brash Fencer opponent, although they don't have bucklers so
remove a D8 from their Defense (Block) pools.

Up to three of the serving staff can draw knives out of hidden sheathes
in their sleeves and start waving them around; use the Street Thug to
represent these opponents.

If you need another infiltrator, one of the minor nobles present is
actually an Unemployed Thespian passing herself off as a visitor from
Gallinea. Nobody's actually heard of her before
this.

The nobles and guests present, including the grooms, won't join the
fight -- they're non-combatants and mostly drunk, so it's up to the
cavaliers to be heroic. If you need stats for any of them, you can use
the Gossiping Courtier, the Boorish Fop, or the Petty Noble. The guards,
drugged as they are, are represented by Infantry Recruits. 

The sound of fighting can be heard further back in the chateau; these
two guards aren't the only ones present, and a group of infiltrators has
been dropped off to engage them and draw the other guards off. The plan
was made assuming that only the two drugged guards would be present --
the infiltrators weren't planning on the Queen's Cavaliers attending the
reception!

The infiltrators won't directly engage with the cavaliers unless
attacked first; instead they are trying to move Hans out to the balcony.
A brawl roll against Hans' Military (Brawl) of 1D8 should be easy
enough, or you can move him around via fiat. Don't make it too hard, but
try to get him at least onto the balcony.

### The Airship Arrives!

At the end of the first or second round of the fight, an airship comes
down from the clouds above the chateau. It'd been waiting around, high
above the chateau, and is there to carry Hans off. Add a Deck of the
Airship index card to the scene. (The airship also potentially has a
Below Decks area and an Atop the Airship Balloon area, if you need to
add extra index cards during the fight.) Anyone falling off the balcony
or the airship dies unless they're the cavaliers, Hans, or the airship
captain -- in which case they catch themselves at the last second and
dangle precariously unless rescued.

There are ten crewmembers -- Bloodthirsty Buccaneers all of them -- but
not all of them can fight the cavaliers since they're busy sailing the
airship. One crewmember will fight, and an additional crewmember equal
to half the number of cavaliers, rounded up. They'll use their pistols
unless the cavaliers come onto the airship. If the fighting members of
the crew and the captain are defeated, the rest of the airship crew
surrenders.

The captain of the ship is a Varendish pirate named Greta Valliken. If
there are three or fewer cavaliers, she is a Devious Smuggler; if there
are four or more, she is a Privateer Captain. Her goal is to capture
Hans, so she won't fire the cannons on the ship toward the chateau, nor
will she take actions that might endanger Hans.

Greta's motivation can be any of the following:

  - She was hired by Altgräfin Bridlin von Wolkenburg to disrupt the
    wedding, forcing the Landgraf to give up some of his claim to the
    Nebelwald as ransom
  - She was hired by Comtesse Josette de Canard-Noir to kidnap Hans, as
    a form of revenge against the Landgraf and the Marquise for a
    canceled order of armor that instead went to Montambre
  - She is Hans' childhood "girlfriend" who he hasn't thought about in
    fifteen years, but is confused enough to believe that he "promised" to
    marry her when they were both five years old
  - She is a rogue airship captain who just hopes to make some money if
    she steals away Hans, and she heard about this wedding while she was
    in Stimmtburg fencing her stolen cargo

Choose one that makes sense based on the facts that have been revealed
through roleplaying before the fight began. You can make the motivation
a mystery that the players can solve -- the first two choices -- or you
can have a somewhat silly out-of-the-blue motivation with the
"girlfriend" choice. The last option is probably the least interesting,
but it's there if you need it. In any case, have Greta make her
motivation clear as she tries to get Hans onto the airship.

### Resolution

The cavaliers really should triumph here, defeating the mercenaries and
Greta, and saving Hans. They're rewarded by both families and poems are
composed telling of their bravery.

If, for some reason, the players fail to win the day, you can have Piers
join the fray, rescuing Hans but not defeating Greta -- leave that to
the cavaliers, or have her escape (although that's less
satisfying).
