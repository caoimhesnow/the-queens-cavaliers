### The Speaker {.cbreakbefore}

A Speaker is an adherent of the Desert Mother, Devra, whose purpose in
Gallinea is to convert the masses. Devraism is legal within Gallinea but
is in conflict with the majority Asrian religion. For this reason,
Speakers usually keep a low profile while spreading their messages of
stoic living and opposition to secular authorities.

While some Speakers are foreign-born, usually from Pitdah or Ubar, there are
a growing number of native Gallineans who have adopted Devraism and work to
convince their countrymen to do so as well. Often these converts tend to be
the most vocal, rabble-rousing firebrands among the Speakers.
