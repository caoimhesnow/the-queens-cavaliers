## Option: Creating a Custom Class

If only one of the classes appeals to you, you can create a custom class
with the MJ's consent. (Having two custom classes is not recommended;
choose one standard class in addition to your custom class.)

Make the following choices and write them down:

**Name and Description:** Decide what role the class will play in
Gallinean, Elaran, or Ifran society. How is this class different from
existing classes?

**Suggested Classes and Passions:** Choose at least 3 suggested classes
and passions that fit the class concept. **Limit:** You can't choose
Duelist as one of the classes.

**Social Rank:** If the class is primarily focused on combat, then the
Social Rank should be Soldier (D6). If the class requires formal
education or apprenticeship, then the Social Rank should be Artisan
(D8). Otherwise the class should probably be Commoner (D0). **Limit:** A
custom class can't be Noble (D10) or Royal (D12) social rank.

**Specialties and Skill Competency:** Choose six different specialties
that make sense for the class; these all gain +1. The Skill Competencies
correspond to those specialties, with the exception of skills that
everyone is already competent in using. **Limits:** Classes never give
specialty ranks in Initiative. Each attribute (Verve, Affinity, Guile)
can have at most 3 specialties associated with it.

**Weapon and Armor Prowess:** If the class would know how to use
specific weapons or armor types, pick up to four of those, total.
Remember that everyone already knows how to use a Knife.

**Bonus Gear:** Choose one outfit that the class will receive for free.
If the class requires the use of one or more tools, pick one of those
tools as well as 4 supplies of the appropriate type. If the class has
weapon or armor prowess, choose up one weapon and one type of armor.
Remember that everyone gets one common weapon for free.

**Style Maneuvers: **Choose six style maneuvers from the list of style
maneuvers that are appropriate for this class: two that allow a reroll
of one skill, two that allow one die to be maximized on a specialty
roll, and two that let you add dice from one pool to another under
specific circumstances.

When you've finished creating your class, let your MJ review it to see
if it fits her concept of the world and the campaign. She can provide
suggestions on how you can modify the class if she sees potential
problems with the class.

##### MJ-Created Classes

MJs, you can create classes too, and offer them as additional choices
for your players. You should try to follow the general guidelines given
for players, although you can customize the social rank, bonus gear,
armor prowess, and weapon prowess. You shouldn't give a class specialty
ranks in Initiative, and a class shouldn't have more than 8 style
maneuvers.
