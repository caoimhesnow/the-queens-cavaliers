## Option: Playing Without Classes ## 

You don't even have to play with classes (or backstories) at all. The MJ
might allow this option if she wants everyone to have the most
flexibility in creating their characters.

A base character starts with the following:

  - Skill Competency in Defense, Initiative, Interaction, and
    Observation.
  - One language.
  - Knife Weapon Prowess.
  - Social Rank of Commoner (D0)/Commoner (D0).
  - One outfit and one common weapon.
  - 30 customizations, replacing the 6 customizations that characters
    normally receive.

You can use those customizations in the following ways:

  - Add Competency in any one skill.
  - Add +1 rank to any Specialty which you have the related skill
    competency. Limits: You can't have more than +2 ranks in any given
    specialty. You can't assign more than eight ranks to the specialties
    corresponding to each attribute (Verge, Affinity, Guile).
  - Add one language.
  - Add one armor prowess or weapon prowess.
  - Increase one of your social ranks by 1, to a limit of Noble
    (D10)/Artisan (D8).
  - Add one style maneuver of your choice. Limits: You can have a
    maximum of six style maneuvers.

Once you have assigned your customizations, you receive four rewards
equal to your Competency Die, two rewards equal to your lowest rank, and
two rewards equal to your highest social rank. You can spend those
normally to buy your starting equipment.

[Class-Free Character Creation]{.boxh2}

Morgan decides she's going to create a character who is all about
airships. She starts with the base character and then spends her 30
customizations.

**Skill Competency:** In addition to the automatic skill competency, she
also chooses to be competent with Dueling (for mid-air swordfights\!),
Military (for mid-air gun fights\! and airship tactics), Nature (so
she'll be good at exploring), and Science (since airships are pretty
advanced technology). This uses four of her customizations.

**Specialty Ranks:** Morgan picks Parry +1 (mid-air swordfights\!),
Dodge +1 (mid-air gun fights\!), Aim +1 (also mid-air gun fights\!),
Strategy +2 (airship tactics), Explore +2 (navigating), Blackpowder +1
(firing cannons\!), and Clockworks +2 (fixing a broken airship). She
also chooses Scholarship +1 (mainly for geographic knowledge), Etiquette
+1 (customs of far-off lands), Inspire +1 (officers should be inspiring,
right?) and Perceive +1 (for looking through a spyglass). Adding up the
totals for each attribute, she finds +6 ranks total for Verve (Parry,
Explore twice, Blackpowder, Inspire, Perceive), +4 ranks total for
Affinity (Aim, Etiquette, Clockworks twice), and +4 ranks for Guile
(Dodge, Strategy twice, Scholarship). This is under the limit of eight
ranks per attribute, so she's good there. This costs 14 of her
customizations.

**Languages:** Morgan decides she will be from Albia, and thus her free
language is Albian. She also gets a bonus language from her +1 rank in
Scholarship, and she picks Gallinean. She decides to also learn Ekalian
(because many sailors are from Ekalia) and Varendish (because the best
cannonsmiths hail from Varendia), and that uses up two more
customizations.

**Armor or Weapon Prowess:** While she doesn't think she needs armor
prowess, Morgan does want to know how to use Swords, Pistols, and
Cannons. She spends three customizations on those.

**Social Rank:** Figuring that airships are rather expensive to
maintain, Morgan pushes her social ranks up to the maximum of Noble
(D10)/Artisan (D8). This uses five of her customizations, and she's only
got two left from the original 30.

**Style Maneuvers:** Looking over the list of style maneuvers<a href="#style-maneuvers" class="xref-inchapter">Style Maneuvers</a>, 
Morgan finds two that thinks will be most appropriate for a future
air-captain like herself. She selects Powdersmith (when creating or
repairing a device with a blackpowder flintlock power source, a
phlogistone furnace power source, or an explosion component, spend 1
Style Point to add Blackpowder dice to a Clockworks roll) and Naval Hilt
(when using a cutlass, spend 1 Style Point to add Explore dice to a
Parry roll). This uses up her last two customizations.

**Starting Equipment:** Naturally, Morgan chooses to start with a corsair outfit,
and for her free weapon chooses a cutlass. She receives rewards of 4D6
(from her Competency Die), 2D8 (her Artisan social rank) and 1D10 (her
Noble social rank). It's not quite enough to buy an airship, so she
instead buys a cutlass (1D6 cost), a mariner's astrolabe (1D6 cost), a
spyglass (1D6 cost), repair tools (1D6 cost), a double pistol (1D8 cost)
because it's cool, and a deck cannon (1D10 cost) since she always wanted
a cannon. Doesn't everyone? This leaves her with a 1D8 reward, which she
chooses to spend on four supplies of clockwork gears so she can repair
an airship or make nifty toys.
