### The Mechanician  {.cbreakbefore}

Fantastic clockwork devices are fashioned by Mechanicians, well-trained
artisans who can engineer complex machinery to accomplish repetitive
tasks. Their gadgets are in great demand throughout society, although
usually only the wealthy can afford the most advanced items.
