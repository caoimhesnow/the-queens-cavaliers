# Classes

Your character in *The Queen's Cavaliers* is a composite of two classes.
Each class provides you with half of your starting skill competencies,
specialties, weapon and armor prowess, social rank, starting gear, and
style Maneuvers.

The various classes can be divided up into three basic categories:
skilled classes, social classes, and fighting classes. These are shown
on the following tables.

For the most well-rounded character, choose a fighting class and either
skilled or social class; that way, you'll be effective in a fight as
well as outside of one. Duelist is a good choice for a fighting class,
if you can't find another that doesn't really fit.

If you are mainly interested in creating things or helping people, you
can choose one skilled class and one social class, or two skilled
classes.

To make a mostly social character, choose a social class and a skilled
class, or two social classes.

Finally, if you want to build a character who excels at combat but not
at much else, choose two fighting classes.

You don't have to choose your classes if you don't feel inspired;
instead you can roll 1D8 for each one. Feel free to reroll if you don't
like your original results!
