A revolutionary, a spy, an assassin, a traitor, a conspirator â€“ these
are terms used to speak of the Provocateur, a shadowy figure enmeshed in
plots within plots. Provocateurs are used by all nations of Elara,
although they are rarely trusted even among those who employ them.

A typical Provocateur does not advertise her profession, so she will
usually rely on her co-class for her public persona.
