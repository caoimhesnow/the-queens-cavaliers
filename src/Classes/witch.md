### The Witch {.cbreakbefore}

An ancient tradition that predates the Qartan Empire, the Witches of
Gallinea are experts at folk remedies, herbal lore, midwifery, and
reading omens. Witchcraft is officially tolerated in Gallinea, although
most devoutly religious people eschew contact with Witches unless
absolutely necessary.

Some Witches are publicly known as such, but most keep their rituals
secret from the authorities, remembering past periods of persecution.
