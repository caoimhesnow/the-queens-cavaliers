# The Barrister {.cbreakbefore}

When someone is accused of a crime anywhere in Elara or wishes to sue
another person, she will usually be represented in court by a Barrister.
Barristers have special training in the law and court procedures, and
are skilled at speaking before a magistrate.

Some Barristers work for the Crown and prosecute lawbreakers, while
others can be hired by those with enough money â€“ usually only the rich.
A recent and controversial policy in Gallinea allows for the indigent
poor to be represented by public defenders, paid for by the Crown.
