# The Brigand {.cbreakbefore}

While Gallinea and most of the Elaran continent are long-settled, that
doesn't always stop opportunists from engaging in banditry. The typical
Brigand in Gallinea is a peasant or even a minor noble whose fortunes
fell and they resorted to force of arms to make their living.

Not all Brigands are necessarily cruel; there's a long history of folk
heroes who rob from the corrupt rich and distribute their loot among the
poor.
