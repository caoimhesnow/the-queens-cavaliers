### The Brigand 

The typical Brigand is a peasant or even a minor noble whose fortunes
fell and they resorted to force of arms to make their living.

Not all Brigands are necessarily cruel; there's a long history of folk
heroes who rob from the corrupt rich and distribute their loot among the
poor.
