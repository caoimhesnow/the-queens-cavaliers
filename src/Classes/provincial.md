### The Provincial 

Outside of the cosmopolitan sprawl of Lutetia are the provinces of
Gallinea – home to commoners and petty noblefolk, many of whom lack
education and refinement. These Provincials – and the Provincials of
other nations – are looked down on by the city folk.

Provincials who come to Lutetia often feel they have something to prove
when dealing with residents of the capital city; it's not uncommon for
brawls to break out in bars because someone's clothes or horse was
insulted.

A few Provincials are minor nobles and choose the Courtier co-class,
although they rarely are afforded the respect given to their urban
cousins.
