# The Explorer {.breakbefore}

The current century is an age of exploration, and the Explorer is one
who is caught up in that zeitgeist, pushing back the frontiers on the
known world. Explorers are alternately courageous or foolhardy depending
on who you talk to, ready to leave their lives behind and seek out the
unknown.

Many explorers are Privateers, although some who move to colonize exotic
lands such as Elissia can be Provincials.
