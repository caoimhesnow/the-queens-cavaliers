# The Constable

In the Gallinean justice system, the Crown is represented by two
separate yet equally important groups: the Constabulary, who
investigate crime, and the Crown Barristers who prosecute the offenders.
The Constables – and their counterparts in neighboring countries –
enforce the laws and protect the people from wrongdoers as well as
capturing those who commit criminal acts.

Most Constables are employed by the Crown or a local province, while a
few have retired and ply their trade as investigators for private hire.
