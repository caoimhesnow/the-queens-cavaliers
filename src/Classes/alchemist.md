# The Alchemist {.cbreakbefore}

Using techniques perfected in the old Qartan Empire, Alchemists brew
potions, poisons, and antidotes based on scientific principles. They can
produce a variety of effects, ranging from healing to magical abilities.

Most Alchemists are successful merchants, many running small
apothecaries to vend their wares.
