### The Veteran 

Gallinea and its neighbors maintain standing armies, composed of
professional soldiers who fight in their wars at home and abroad. The
most recent war between Gallinea and Albia lasted for a total of 20
years, ending 6 years ago with the marriage of then-princess Mariana
(now Queen Mariana) to prince Carolus of Albia.

Veterans of that and other wars are well-trained in the art of battle,
and if not currently part of a military unit, often join mercenary
companies or guard regiments rather than settle down into a civilian
lifestyle.
