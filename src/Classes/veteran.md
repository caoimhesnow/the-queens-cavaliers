### The Veteran  {.cbreakbefore}

Gallinea and its neighbors maintain standing armies, composed of
professional soldiers who fight in their wars at home and abroad. The
most recent war between Gallinea and Albia lasted for a total of 20
years, ending 6 years ago with the marriage of then-princess Mariana
(now Queen Mariana) to prince Carolus of Albia.
