Courtiers revel in their lives of luxury, but all know that they only
continue to have such glamorous lives at the forbearance of their
matrons and patrons. A Courtier who is outcast from polite society may
return to take revenge upon a noblewoman or nobleman.

Magicks and the sciences are a draw to the Courier, as well as some
martial pursuits; nobles often have time to develop such skills at their
leisure.
