### The Courtier

Members of the Gallinean royal court, and other noble courts, are
Courtiers. They are well-educated, trained in etiquette and social
graces, and have preternatural skill for plotting and intrigue.

Courtiers revel in their lives of luxury, but all know that they only
continue to have such glamorous lives at the forbearance of their
matrons and patrons. A Courtier who is outcast from polite society may
return to take revenge upon a noblewoman or nobleman.

Magicks and the sciences are a draw to the Courier, as well as some
martial pursuits; nobles often have time to develop such skills at their
leisure.
