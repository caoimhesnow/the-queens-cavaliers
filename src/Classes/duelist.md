### The Duelist {.cbreakbefore}

A Duelist is a swashbuckling swordfighter who lives by her wits and her
skill at her blade. She may be a member of the Queen's Cavaliers, or a
rival organization, or may be a freelance fencer who runs her own
dueling school. Quite a few actors have been known to take up dueling as
well.
