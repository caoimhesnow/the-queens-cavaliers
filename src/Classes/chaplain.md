A Chaplain is a clergy member of an organized religion, usually Asrian.
The duties can vary but many times a Chaplain is found serving among
military members or as a member of the court. Chaplains have minimal
training in combat but are skilled at interacting with people.

Most Chaplains in Gallinea follow the Asrian faith, devoted to the
goddess-empress Eserre. Dodekan priests from Ekalia are also found as
Chaplains, although rarely outside of the Ekalia Islands. Devraist
priests are known as Speakers, and it's rare to meet a Devraist
Chaplain.

:# The Nine Precepts of the Asrian Church

Asrianism holds that the goddess Eserre (known as *Ashra* in Old Qartan) gave humanity nine
principles. Those are:

:#  The Three Professions

1. There is one Sun in the sky, source of light and life.
2. Light, life, and love are the Sun's gifts to us.
3. We are all of us children of the Sun.

:# The Three Directives

4. Freely partake of only that which has been given to you.
5. Repay kindness three times, and harm but once.
6. Truth endures forever while falsehoods wither in the light.

:# The Three Prohibitions
7. Let no man be superior to a woman.
8. Let no one own another person.
9. Let no one kill except to sustain life.

While individual Chaplains may disagree on the interpretations of the Nine Precepts, all agree
that they are the words of the Goddess-Empress.
