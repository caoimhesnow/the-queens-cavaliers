A Chaplain is a clergy member of an organized religion, usually Asrian.
The duties can vary but many times a Chaplain is found serving among
military members or as a member of the court. Chaplains have minimal
training in combat but are skilled at interacting with people.

Most Chaplains in Gallinea follow the Asrian faith, devoted to the
goddess-empress Eserre. Dodekan priests from Achalia are also found as
Chaplains, although rarely outside of the Achalian Islands. Devraist
priests are known as Speakers, and it's rare to meet a Devraist
Chaplain.
