# Gender, Sexuality, and Race # {.breakbefore}

In general, Gallinea is a diverse nation, full of people of all genders,
sexualities, and races. While that mostly holds true upon closer
examination, the Land of the Ascendant Pegasus does still retain some
inequalities based on old traditions and biases.

## Gender

Gallinean custom has long held the primacy of women within society --
after all, the traditionalists argue, it is women who maintain the
stability of culture. The identity of one's other parent may be in
doubt, but there's never a question about who gave birth to a child.
Thus, inheritance passes along matrilineal lines and thus concentrating
wealth and societal power among women.

This rule still holds true for most nobles -- and continues to be an
expectation of the Royalty -- but has lost popularity among those in the
lower social classes. 

### The Delphian Reforms

Queen Delphine, great-grandmother of current queen Mariana, decreed in
1172 PQ that inheritance within Gallinea would pass to the oldest child
regardless of gender -- and as much as this pleased the commoners, it
enraged the nobility to the same extent. Two years later, in 1174 PQ,
she rescinded that decree and replaced it with a rule that each family
could designate either the oldest daughter or oldest son as inheritor.
Most nobles stuck to the old ways, however, and named daughters as
heirs.

Delphine's granddaughter, Queen Elisse III, expanded the decree in 1240
to allow any child to be named as an heir, regardless of birth order or
gender, as part of her Elissian Reforms. After Elisse's assassination,
her husband (as prince-regent) and her daughter Queen Mariana maintained
the Reforms enacted by Elisse before her death, but haven't yet enacted
the further reforms desired by the late queen.

Besides inheritance, other forms of gender discrimination have likewise
been banned since Delphine's reign, but most positions of authority and
responsibility within Gallinean higher society are still held by women.

### Gender and the Church

Traditional Asrian theology holds that the First Prohibition, "Let no
man be superior to a woman," defines a role for a woman as the head of a
family, head of a country, and head of a business, but modern
interpretations over the last millennium have taken this to be a call
for gender-neutrality and lack of gender-based oppression.

The Asrian Church has thus become a bastion of gender equality, although
with persistent trappings of matriarchy -- Eserre is viewed as a sun
goddess as opposed to a gender-neutral deity, for example. The Church is
headed by the Bride of the Sun and her Handmaidens, which are ceremonial
positions that are treated as female for liturgical purposes, regardless
of the gender of the occupant of the office. 

Within Gallinean politics, the Church takes a middle line between the
beliefs of the Monarchy and the nobility, not quite willing to fully
endorse the Elissian Reforms but nonetheless prompting for greater
equality of gender within Asrian culture.

### Gender Diversity 

With the increased acceptance of gender equality has also come greater
acceptance of those who don't fall into a binary gender assigned to them
at birth. Gender roles have become understood as a question of
self-identification, including people who exist outside of a strict
binary as well as those who are comfortable within it.

Female and male identities are considered legitimate regardless of birth
assignment. Legal recognition of gender is not required for all but
those in the higher tiers of society, and the procedure itself is a
relatively simple procedure before a or a royal bailiff or a provincial
prévôt. Petitioners receive a decree in the name of the queen or the
nobility of the province, recognizing their gender for all purposes.

The Elissian Decrees went further than that, and legally recognized all
variations of gender identity -- from those without gender at all to
those who combine either binary gender in ways unique to that
individual. This codified a long-standing practice among the lower and
middle classes of affirming the genders of everyone, not just those
within a strict binary.

### Gender in the Gallinean Language

The Gallinean language is a relatively genderless tongue that does not
require that a grammatical gender be assigned to every noun, verb, or
pronoun. However, as with most Qartan-descended languages, many
traditional names for occupations, noble titles, place of origin, and so
on, are expressed in female terminology. Older Gallineans consider these
terms to be gender-neutral by default, but younger speakers of the
language are moving toward more inclusive speech.

"She" is the default pronoun for a person of unspecified gender within
classical Gallinean, but there has been some progress made toward using
"they" as gender-neutral as well. "Iel/iem/ier/iels/ielself", a set of
non-binary pronouns used in some classical writings, has made a recent
resurgence and is used within the texts of the Elissian Reforms.

While physiological alterations are never required of those asserting
their gender within Gallinean society -- for legal or for social
purposes -- many such individuals desire changes to their bodies to
better match their self-image. Long-known alchemical formulations can
provide the equivalent of hormone replacement to those who wish it, and
a number of medical procedures exist that can provide further changes to
bring one's body into conformance with their stated gender.

## Sexuality

The concept of "homosexuality" and "heterosexuality" as distinct sexual
orientations is unknown within Gallinean society. Society, overall, is
bisexual and one's preference for specific genders is considered a
personal matter. No one cares whether this is an inborn preference or a
matter of choice; you love who you love, and that's what matters. 

The second Profession of Asrianism states that love is a gift from
Eserre herself, and the Books of the Sun encourage all to love as freely
as you wish, love as deeply as you wish, and love whomever you wish.
Eserre herself is depicted as married to a woman, the first Bride of the
Sun, and thus all subsequent leaders of the Asrian church have been
considered liturgically female.

### Marriage in Gallinea
In Gallinea, marriage equality has long been the standard -- as long as marriage 
itself has been practiced. Same-gender marriage is also universally accepted 
among Gallinea's neighbors in Elara.

Marriage or partnership within Gallinean culture can be between a woman
and a man, a woman and a woman, a man and a man, and recently, between
any one person and another regardless of gender or lack thereof.
Monogamy is expected among Asrian Gallineans, although monoamory is a
matter left up to the people in the relationship. Thus, you can only be
married to one person, but it a mutual decision between the two of you
whether it is an open relationship or a closed one.

The most recent royal same-gender marriage, in 1126, was between Queen Elisse II, 
great-grandmother of Mariana II, and her Princess-Consort, Clarisse -- 
who would later go on to serve as Princess-Regent for their young daughter, future Queen Delphine.

The term "marriage" is reserved for those couples united in a religious
ceremony; otherwise it is called a "partnership". Terms such as "wife",
"husband", "spouse", or "partner", are not restricted to one type of
union; as with many other decisions this is made by each couple as they
choose. Gallineans consider all terms to refer to the same concept,
although classical Gallinean traditionally calls male spouses "husbands"
and female spouses "wives."

### Asexuality

In recent years, greater acceptance has been made of those who are not
sexually attracted at all. Previously, asexual people were thought of as
being eccentric, of being damaged in some way, or as just not having
found the right person yet. One decree in the Elissian Reforms
establishes full legal equality, including inheritance rights, to people
who are asexual.

Sexuality Terminology

- **Jathyc:** An adjective describing a sexual or romantic relationship between two men, named after the Ekalian deity Jathys, god of craftsmanship and commerce.
- **Outré:** An archaic adjective describing a man who is exclusively attracted to women, or a woman who is exclusively attracted to men.  Often considered offensive.
- **Reian (adj):** A recently-coined adjective describing someone who does not
  feel sexual attraction, or sometimes, romantic attraction. Named after
  the Ekalian deity Reios, god of politics and the underworld.
- **Reian (n)**. Someone whose sexuality is *reian (adj)*.
- **Sapphique:** An adjective describing a sexual or romantic relationship between two women, named after Safira, the first Bride of the Sun according to Asrian theology.

There are no particular terms for being a bisexual person, a lesbian, or a gay man in Gallinean. Such concepts don't exist in Elaran cultures.
