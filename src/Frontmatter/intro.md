France, circa the early-to-mid 1600s.  Inspired by *The Three Musketeers* and other swashbuckling stories, 
*TWotQC* presents a queer-inclusive, racially diverse, feminist take on the genre, while also throwing in airships, alchemy
clockwork devices, witches, and -- best of all -- charmwoven clothing.

[Savage Worlds]{.tm}, [FATE]{.tm}, [7th Sea]{.tm}, [GURPS]{.tm}, [Pathfinder]{.tm}, [Dungeons & Dragons]{.tm}, and many more 
-- or you can read the book just to get
ideas for your own creations. You can even publish material based in the *The World of the Queen's Cavaliers*, as long as you

*The Queen's Cavaliers* is a tabletop roleplaying game set in an alternate fantasy France, circa the early-to-mid 1600s. 
Inspired by *The Three Musketeers* and other swashbuckling stories, *TQC*'s skill system is flexible and designed to be
entertaining, with more options than simply doing damage from round to round. Want to swing on a chandelier to gain 
advantage over your foes, or recite an epic poem to build style points? These are all valid and effective strategies in *TQC*.

Mechanically, *TQC* uses a dice pool system based primarily on your three attributes: **Verve**, **Affinity**, and **Guile**. 
Skills and specialties grant you extra dice, as do weapons and tools. *Charmwoven apparel* is unique to the setting -- 
your clothes don't just make you look fashionable but also enhance your dice pools ... assuming you don't violate the 
Laws of Fashion and end up garishly attired.

Clockwork devices are also common in the setting, with mechanician characters able to build or even invent useful gadgets 
ranging from repeating crossbows to flying airships.

Your *TQC* character is built by combining together two classes to create a unique role; with over 20 classes, that gives 
hundreds of combinations such as Duelist/Virtuosa, Brigand/Chirurgeon, Charmweaver/Witch, or Mechanician/Visionary. 
These class pairings give you a structure that speeds character creation while allowing for creative combinations to express 
your character's uniqueness.
