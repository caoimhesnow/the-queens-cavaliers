## The Role of Seafaring in Gallinea

Seafaring can be a part of any type of game, especially if the
characters do a great deal of traveling outside of Gallinea. It can even
be the focus of the game, if the MJ decides that those are types of
stories she would like to tell. While most seafaring adventures can be
achieved through roleplaying and the existing rules, there are a few
special considerations necessary to accommodate shipboard combat and
intrigue.

### Trade

Sailing ships are the most economical manner of transporting trade good
from one place to another, and most nations are dependent upon trade to
some degree. Vessels range from single privately-owned ships that may be
chartered by a merchant for a single voyage, to large fleets owned by
wealthy families or mercantile guilds. Most merchant ships fly under the
flag of their port of origin, making them targets for enemy navies and
pirates.

Table: Trade Goods

| Country        | Exports                              |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Gallinea       | wine, perfume, textiles              |
| Albia          | medicinal herbs, alchemical draughts | 
| Ekalia         | olives, oils, minerals               | 
| Ondala         | spices, rubber, religious goods      | 
| Talania        | clockworks, tools, furs              | 
| Varendia       | clockworks, minerals, weapons        | 
| Northern Ifran | spices, minerals, cocoa              | 
| West Ifran     | tobacco, cotton, tea                 | 

### Military

Naval warfare has been a reality since before the days of the Qartan
Empire. Even the most peaceful of nations maintains a strong navy for
self-defense and the protection of its trade vessels. The shipyards of
the traditionally warlike nations are scrutinized carefully by their
neighbors, as an increase in shipbuilding could indicate hostile
intentions.

**Gallinea** is a major power in part because of her powerful fleet.
Past wars have taught the matriarchy that a free and open society
requires strong security to survive. Occasional displays of that métier
have helped to maintain the nation's position of peace and
inclusiveness.

**Albia**'s navy is substantially smaller than it was during the war,
chiefly due to the ongoing threat of Ekalia. With the exception of
merchant escorts and a few vessels tasked for exploration, the majority
of Albia's fleet patrols its own shores. There are rumors, however, that
King Edgar II is raising funds to build more ships in order to revive
the nation's old policy of expansionism.

While the navy of **Ekalia** is in theory a unified force, and the
largest and most powerful in the world, each squadron within the fleet
is owned and controlled by one of the merchant houses. Each squadron
therefore places the financial and political interests of their
sponsoring house above those of the homeland. This is why merchant
vessels of other nations particularly fear the sight of Ekalian naval
ships, and consider them to be no better than pirates.

**Ondala**'s relatively small navy is tied up dealing New Cordera. In
addition to its own small fleet, Ondala hires private vessels to
supplement its maritime power. They pose little threat to other nations,
simply because they have no resources to dedicate to war. This leaves
them vulnerable, and reliant upon foreign trade agreements to aid in
their defense.

**Talania** has no official navy, but employs mercenaries and pirates to
act in its defense as needed. These ships often fly the Talanian flag
and colors even when not acting in an official capacity for the nation,
which has led to many embarrassing diplomatic incidents. Young Talanians
often sign on to such ships simply for the prospect of traveling to
somewhere warmer.

Each of the coastal duchies and kingdoms of **Varendia** has its own
navy, habitually utilized against each other during internal conflicts.
This characteristically involves acts of piracy committed against
political rivals. The Varendians do possess some of the most advanced
ships on the seas, however, and if they were able to unite could pose a
substantial military threat.

The **Ifran** nations maintain no navies of their own. The city-states
of North Ifran rely upon trade agreements for their own coastal
defenses, and the Calipha of Ubar has expressly stated that she will not
trade with any nation that makes war in her waters. West Ifran is under
the protection of the Gallinean navy, due to the presence of its
colonies there.

### Exploration

The world is larger than the lands shown on the map, and the brave and
adventurous are always on the hunt for new opportunities for adventure.
Merchants eternally seek both new markets to sell to, and novel goods to
import, and often sponsor expeditions. Expansionist nations like Albia
simply desire new lands to conquer and colonize. If your MJ wants to
tell stories of exploration, it's also a way for her to make her own
contributions to the world of Gallinea.

### Piracy

Plays and popular fiction have left the general public with the
impression that pirates are disgruntled men seeking a chance to prove
themselves equal, or even superior, to women, and evil, greedy women
pursuing banditry at sea. The reality is that better than half of all
piracy is state-sponsored, a means for nations to strike at each other
while maintaining diplomatic deniability. In times of peace, it is a way
to harm rivals economically by interfering with commerce, and militarily
by damaging their navies.

Many pirates, though, are independent operators, seeking their own
fortune by preying upon weaker, and wealthier, vessels. Piracy is
largely democratic, with Capitaines and officers elected to their
positions by the crew based on their experience and leadership
qualities. Treasures from captured ships are divided fairly and
equitably among the crew. The decision to become a pirate is often a
political one, drawing both commoners and nobility who are tired of the
oppression that exists in even the most liberal monarchies.

### The Queen's Cavaliers at Sea

Members of the Queen's Cavaliers may be involved with any of the above
activities. They may book passage on any of the above types of vessels
while traveling on a mission. They may be assigned by the Queen to sail
with a merchant ship carrying important cargo, or on a naval vessel to
assist in a military operation. The might be sent on a mission of
exploration as the Queen's personal agents. They could either be sent to
battle dread pirates, or called upon to as pirates against a rival
nation. Any of these could be done as a single story, or as the primary
focus of the game.

## Seafaring Roles

Each person aboard a ship has a clear set of responsibilities.
Discipline is essential to safe passage and survival, and those who
shirk their duties put everyone's lives at risk. If your game places a
heavy emphasis on seafaring, the MJ should let you know at character
creation, and direct you to the appropriate character roles listed here.
In most cases, at least on Character Class should probably by Privateer.
Non-seafaring characters can theoretically fulfill one of the roles
below, based on their Attributes and Skills even if their Classes do not
seem to directly align.

### Capitaine (Captain)

The Capitaine is the person in command of the vessel, no matter its size
or crew compliment. Everyone aboard ship is under the Capitaine's
authority, regardless of their rank or social status on land. While all
Capitaines have a large degree of autonomy, naval Capitaines are
expected to comply with and enforce their nation's regulations, while
merchant Capitaine must abide by the laws and rules of whoever controls
the waters they are sailing in. Pirate Capitaines are often elected by
their crew, who follow voluntarily so long as their leadership is fair
and prizes are shared fairly and equitably.

In combat, the Capitaine makes all of the decisions and issues orders
for other crew members to carry out. If there is no other helmsman, the
Capitaine often takes the wheel.

Suggested Classes for a Capitaine include Courtier, Duelist, Envoy, Fusilier, Privateer, and Veteran.

::::::::::::::::::::::: sidebar ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:# Specialties on Ships

**Blackpowder** is used by the maîtresse d'armes à feu to fire the ship's cannons.
**Clockworks** is used by the charpentier to repair Wound taken by the ship.
**Calculate** is used by the navigateur to locate the ship's position and chart a course to their destination.
**Explore** is used by any member of the crew to do the basic job of manning the ship.
**Strategy** is used by the capitaine during combat to gain and bestow advantage on crew members.
**Treat** and **Surgery** are used by the chirurgeon to care for injured crewmembers.
**Weave** is used by the Maîtresse de Voiles to repair Yield taken by the ship.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Charpentier (Carpenter)

The ship's Charpentier is responsible for maintenance and repairs to the
ship, including patching the hull, replacing broken masts, and scraping
barnacles off the sides of the ship. She supervises all crew members
tasked with related duties. She is also in charge of the creation of all
things that need to be crafted aboard ship, from furniture to crests to
wooden legs. The Charpentier is often a low-ranking sailor with no
authority or role in the chain of command, but is excused from combat
operations because like the Chirurgeon her expertise will be needed
later.

Suggested Classes for a ship's Charpentier include Dogsbody, Mechanician, Privateer, Provincial, and Veteran.

:# Ship Repair

Fixing a ship requires the Clockworks specialty.

**Competency Optional:** You can make a Clockworks roll to repair a ship even if you
aren't competent in Science.

**Base Time:** Repairing a ship takes 1 hour.

**Item Die:** Add the Item Die of your shipwright's tools or drydock to your dice pool.

**Supplies:** Units of shipbuilding supplies are required for repairing a ship.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on repair to add a Bonus Die to your dice pool.
The size of that die is limited by your number of ranks in Science (Clockworks), with a
minimum of 1D6.

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to repair a ship by taking a Drop penalty on your die roll.
You can't rush a repair that you're taking extra time on. The size of the drop penalty depends on
how much you rush the crafting. For example, if you make repairs in one minute, you have a Drop 4 penalty.

::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::::::::::
| Clockworks | Shipboard                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| Base Time  | 1 hour                            |
| Opposition | Automatic success, unless rushing |
| Item Die   | Shipwright's tools, drydock       |
| Supplies   | Shipbuilding supplies             |
| Bonus Die  | Extra time                        |
| +          | Repair 1 wound to a ship          |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Repair 1 wound to a ship (at least 1 unit of shipbuilding supplies):** You remove one wound from the ship. 
For every three wounds removed, or fraction thereof, you spend 1 quantity of shipbuilding supplies.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### Chirurgeon

The role of Chirurgeon is an important one aboard ship. Not only is she
responsible for stitching together wounded sailors following battles or
rigging accidents, she must treat and manage all illnesses from diseases
to nutritional ailments like scurvy. Most large naval vessels, and more
affluent merchant and pirate ships, fill the role of Chirurgeon with an
actual trained physician. Smaller, poorer vessels often delegate various
duties to either those with some medical experience. In the absence of
training, tasks fall to those who have the tools. Often, the Maîtresse
de Voiles will be responsible for sewing up wounds, and the Charpentier
or Maîtresse d'Équipage will be called upon to perform life-saving
amputations.

At least one of the Chirurgeon's Classes should be Chirurgeon. Any other
Class is possible, but Alchemist, Chaplain, Courtier, Envoy, Virtuosa,
and Witch all pair nicely for a ship's Chirurgeon.

### Maîtresse d'Armes à Feu (Mistress of Guns)

The Maîtresse d'Armes à Feu is responsible for all gunpowder weapons
aboard ship, from cannons to personal longarms and pistols. She is
responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of those weapons, and the
training of crew members in their use. Her duties also include stowing
of heavy shot in a manner that does not affect the ship's ballast, and
keeping powder dry and safely stores in order to prevent fires and
explosions.

In combat, the Maîtresse d'Armes à Feu supervises the cannon crews
aboard deck. She carries out the Capitaine's orders, but can also make
decisions to fire or not based on opportunities that arise and fall away
as the ships move into and out of firing position.

Suggested Classes for a ship's Maîtresse d'Armes à Feu include
Alchemist, Fusilier, Mechanician, Privateer, and Veteran.

### Maîtresse d'équipage (Boatswain or Bosun)

The Maîtresse d'Équipage is the ship's supply officer, in charge of
procuring and securing necessary items such as food, fresh water,
medicines, and gunpowder. She also supervises ordinary, day-to-day
operations performed by the crew both above and below decks. On most
ships, the Maîtresse d'Équipage is the senior crew member, but not an
officer. Aboard merchant and pirate ships, the Maîtresse d'Équipage is
responsible for keeping track of all cargo inventories. On pirate ships,
she is responsible for tracking shares of treasure awarded to all crew
members, and the distribution of those shares.

Suggested Classes for a Maîtresse d'Équipage include Constable,
Courtier, Duelist, Envoy, Fusilier, Privateer, and Veteran.

### Maîtresse de Voiles (Mistress of Sails)

The Maîtresse de Voiles is in charge of all of the ship's rigging,
including both operations, repairs, and all crew members responsible for
those tasks. She is also in charge of all ropes, and the ship's anchor.
On naval vessels, the Maîtresse de Voiles is often the highest ranking
warrant officer.

Suggested Classes for a ship's Maîtresse de Voiles include Charmweaver,
Courtier, Duelist, Fusilier, Privateer, and Veteran.

:::::: boxtext :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:# Sail and Rigging Repair

Fixing a ship's sails and rigging uses the Weave specialty.

**Competency Optional:** You can make a Weave roll to repair a ship even if you aren't competent in Magicks.

**Base Time:** Repairing a ship's sails takes 1 minute.

**Fully Repaired after 1 Hour:** If you spend at least one hour repairing sails and rigging,
all yield is removed from the ship.

**Item Die:** Add the Item Die of your sailmaker's tools or drydock to your dice pool.

**Supplies:** Units of sailmaking supplies are required for repairing a ship.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on repair to add a Bonus Die to your dice pool.
The size of that die is limited by your number of ranks in Magicks (Weave), with a
minimum of 1D6.

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to repair a ship by taking a Drop penalty on your die roll.
You can't rush a repair that you're taking extra time on. The size of the drop penalty depends on
how much you rush the repairs. For example, if you make repairs as one action, have a Drop 4 penalty.

::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::::::::::
| Weave      | Shipboard                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| Base Time  | 1 minute                          |
| Opposition | Automatic success, unless rushing |
| Item Die   | Tailoring tools                   |
| Supplies   | Sailmaking supplies               |
| Bonus Die  | Extra time                        |
| +          | Remove 1 yield from a ship        |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Remove 1 yield from a ship (at least 1 unit of shipmaking supplies):** You remove one yield from
the ship. For every 9 yield removed in this way, you spend 1 unit of shipmaking supplies.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Navigateur (Navigateur)

The Navigateur is charged with plotting the ship's course, based upon
the Capitaine's orders. This means being able to read the position of
the sun during the day, and the stars at night, as well as reading a
map, preparing charts, and calculating longitude and latitude.

On military vessels, the Navigateur is known by the title of
Quartier-maîtresse. Their role and duties should not be confused with
the separate position of Quartier-maîtresse aboard merchant and pirate
vessels.

Suggested Classes for a ship's Navigateur include Alchemist, Explorer,
Mechanician, Privateer, Visionary, and Witch.

### Quartier-maîtresse (Quartermistress)

On merchant and pirate vessels the Quartier-maîtresse is the
second-in-command, and responsible for enforcing discipline and ensuring
that the Capitaine's orders are carried out. The Quartier-maîtresse is
also in charge of ship's supplies, assignment of crew and quest
quarters, and often acts as helmsman during battle.

On naval vessels title of Quartier-maîtresse is used to refer to the
Navigateur. The duties described above, include discipline and supply
responsibilities, are carried out by the highest-ranking officer below
the Capitaine, known as the first mate.

Suggested Classes for a ship's Quartier-maîtresse include Barrister,
Constable, Courtier, Envoy, Privateer, and Veteran.

### Marin (Sailor)

Marins are the ordinary crew members charged with the mundane tasks of
keeping the ship operational. Naval Marins may be volunteers or
conscripts and are generally from the lower social classes. Merchant
Marins are almost always hired hands with some level of experience.
Pirate Marins are by and large aboard of their own free will and often
ex-naval Marins, with a few involuntary conscripts aboard if the crew is
understaffed or in need to special skills.

In combat, Marins may operate cannon, fire weapons, participate in boarding actions, or aid in putting out fires.

Suggested Classes for a Marins include Brigand, Charlatan, Dogsbody,
Duelist, Fusilier, Privateer, Provincial, and Veteran.

::::::::::::::::::::::::: optional ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:# Injured or Killed Crewmembers 

A ship functioning with less than the necessary amount of crew can still function,
but takes a Drop penalty on all actions. This is addition to any penalty imposed by
damage to the ship itself.

The amount of the Drop penalty depends on the base crew of the ship, as shown below.

Table: Crew Casualties and Drop Penalties

| Crew Size  | Drop 1  | Drop 2  | Drop 4  | Disabled |
| :----------| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :------: |
|  1 to  3   |         |         |         |  1 down  |
|  4 to  7   |         |         |  1 down |  2 down  |
|  8 to 15   |         |  1 down |  2 down |  4 down  |
| 16 to 31   |  1 down |  2 down |  4 down |  8 down  |
| 32 to 63   |  2 down |  4 down |  8 down | 12 down  |
| 64 or more |  4 down |  8 down | 12 down | 16 down  |

In this context, a *casualty* refers to any crewmember who isn't present, is dying or dead,
or has at least 1 wound. Thus, if 11 people try to sail a schooner, which has a normal crew
size of 16, they have 5 casualties due to the 5 "missing" crewmembers. This gives a Drop 4
penalty on all actions. If 3 of those 11 get wounded, the ship now has 8 casualties, which
means it can't function.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Seafaring Personalities

There are a number of legendary figures who made their names on the high
seas. These can be enemies or allies to the Queen's Cavaliers, or more
neutral, recurring supporting characters. They serves as an example of
the variety of seafaring characters possible in the world of Gallinea.

### Jossete Laffite

The notorious Gallinea-born Jossete Laffite began her career as a
smuggler, moving contraband, other pirates' goods, and even legal
merchandise for merchants seeking to avoid taxation. Her sister
Plourette handled the dry land end of the operation, moving merchandise
though a network of warehouses and shops, while Jossete handled the
movement of cargo by ship, initially using hired vessels.

Over time, Jossete became wealthy enough to buy her own ship, and
decided to consolidate her operations by taking to piracy directly. She
continued to fence merchandise for other pirates as well, and her
operation grew quite large. This was made possible by the war with
Albia, and the Gallinean navy being too tied up to deal with piracy. Her
crimes were further mitigated by the fact that Jossete never preyed upon
Gallinean ships. Toward the end of the war, she even assisted the
Gallnean navy in fleet actions against Albia.

Since the end of the war, Jossete has aided the Queen's Cavaliers on a
number of occasions, offering aid and transport. She has also run afoul
of the Cavaliers as well, smuggling and fencing items of importance to
the Queen. Jossete is rumored to currently be in the employ of Ondala,
acting as a spy for them against Albia, and possibly against Gallinea as
well. Only time will if she is truly friend or foe.

### Admiral Hopkin, Viscount Norfolk

Admiral Norfolk is a flag officer of the Albian Navy, noted for is
rousing leadership, his mastery of strategy and tactics, and his
unconventional maneuvers which have led to an astonishing number of
naval victories. He is respected by other Capitaines, rather than fears,
although no one wants to go up against him in battle.

Of noble birth, Norfolk is extremely charming and has been offered
numerous diplomatic posts, all of which he has declined. When the war
between Albia and Gallinea ended, Norfolk was one of the official envoys
sent to sign the peace treaty. He has sworn that he will command a ship
until he is no longer able, and that he would prefer to die at sea, in
combat.

Norfolk is missing his right arm, lost in a battle against Ondala during
which he managed to remain conscious and command his crew to victory.
The arm has been replaced with a crude clockwork, which contains a
compass, sextant, and spyglass. He is also missing his left eye, a
casualty of a battle with Gallinea during the war, which is covered with
a patch embroidered to resemble the Albian flag.

### Pero de Cordera y Ramos

Born into a long line of sailors, de Cordera first took to the seas at
the age of 13 on an Ondalan naval vessel. He worked his way up to
Capitaine of his own ship, then to the rank of *teniente general*,
equivalent to commodore in the Gallinean navy. He became known for the
care and concern he shows to his crew, who see him as a beloved father
figure and are extremely loyal to him.

More recently, de Cordera went rogue and led a portion of the Ondalan
fleet against the Gallinean navy. His forces were soundly defeated, and
he was summoned home to face a military tribunal. He did not return, nor
did his flagship, two other ships under his command, and a significant
portion of their crews. He remains on the run, under a death sentence
from the Ondalan government, and has turned to piracy as a means of
survival.

It is rumored that de Cordera is seeking to become an explorer, taking
his crew to new lands, perhaps to establish a colony far from the reach
of his government and his enemies. In order to fund this, the boldness
and frequency of his pirate raids have increased, bringing him into
conflict with the Gallinean navy, and the Queen's Cavaliers.

### Salina of Talania

The pirate queen Salina is a witch, and claims to be the reincarnation
of the legendary warrior Salina, who held off the Qartan Empire's
attempted invasion of Talania centuries ago. She has attracted a crew,
whom some say is actually a cult, primarily of young Talanians who see
her as the fulfillment of various ancient prophesies. Sailors of other
nations, including Varendians and Ifrani, have also begun to follow her
as her power and influence has increased.

Salina's ships, for she has many, ply the waters of the Middle Sea, from
Talania to Qarta, along the Dragon Coast to the shoreline of Northern
Ifran. She claims the entirety of the Middle Sea as her kingdom, and
demands that all ships large and small pay tribute to her. She fears no
navy, and with each conquest she gains more ships, and her cult seems to
grow proportionately to provide her with crews for those ships.

It is rumored that Salina has incredible magical powers, and that she is
obsessed with all manner of occult objects and ancient artifacts. This
has brought her and her agents into conflict with the Queen's Cavaliers
on a number of occasions, as she has attempted to steal both Gallinean
cultural artifacts dating from the Qartan Empire and more recent
military innovations.

## Ship Qualities

Like characters, ships have qualities and and stats, and can take both
wounds and yield.

**Crew**: The minimum number of crew members required to operate the
rigging, sails, and helm. If there is less than this number of crew
members, the ship cannot operate.

**Cargo**: The amount of space devoted to cargo, in the abstract. Rather
than try to keep track of each crate and barrel aboard ship, cargo space
is To determine the value of the cargo, multiple the cargo space times
the cost of goods. If 20 cargo areas are filled with Uncommon goods
(d8), the value is 20d8; if 30 cargo areas are filled with Common (d6)
cargo, the value is 30d6.

**Speed**: This is the number of leagues a ship can travel per day with typical winds. A league is approximately 2 miles.

**Maneuverability**: This is the Bonus Die the ship gets for Combat actions based on how well it handles.

**Guns**: The total number of cannon aboard the ship. On any given round, only up to half of a ship's cannon can fire at one time.

**Yield**: This is the amount of damage that the ship's rigging can
sustain before the ship is rendered inoperable and no longer moves in
any controlled fashion. Assuming that the ship has the materials to do
so, Yield can be cleared with an hour spent effecting repairs.

**Wounds**: This is how much damage the ship's hull can sustain before
sinking. Wounds to a ship add Drop penalties at the rate of 100 Wounds
per point of penalty.

The following table shows the damage results for a typical 400-wound
ship such as a brigantine. Smaller or larger ships will have different
wound tracks as listed below; each step represents 100 points of wound
taken.

Table: Damage to Ships

| Wounds | Drop Penalty | Yield Limit |
| :----- | :----------- | :---------- |
| None   | Drop 0       |             |
| 100    | Drop 1       |  -25 Yield  |
| 200    | Drop 2       |  -50 Yield  |
| 300    | Drop 4       | -100 Yield  |
| 400    | Sinking      | -200 Yield  |

At the end of ship-to-ship combat, any Sinking NPC ship goes under
unless player characters with a Charpentier are ready to board and make
a Clockworks repair roll.

A player character ship that is Sinking can either be allowed to go
under, or a Clockworks roll can be made immediately to try to
initiate emergency maintenance to keep the ship afloat for one minute per success point spent.

## Ship Types

There are several broad categories of ships, each designed for specific
purposes, and varying in terms of necessary crew, cargo space, and
firepower. Individual ships may vary, based on the builder and
customization performed by the owner, but the majority of the ships
encountered by the Queen's Cavaliers will be of these common types.

### Brigantine

A brigantine is a two-masted ship, the front mast with square-rigged
sails and the rear mast with a fore-and-aft configuration and possibly a
topsail. It is larger than a chaloupe or schooner, but smaller than a
frigate or warship. Brigantines are often used as cargo ships by
merchants. In military use, they are often part of a fleet and used to
protect larger ships.

:::::::::::::::::::: statblock :::::::::

  - **Guns:** 12
  - **Yield:** 300
  - **Wounds:** 400 (Drop 1, Drop 2, Drop 4, Sinking)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Chaloupe

A *chaloupe*, or sloop, is a sailboat with a single mast and triangular
fore-and-aft sails (a mainsail and a jib). They are used mainly as
pleasure craft, but due to their size, speed, and maneuverability are
also used as couriers and reconnaissance vessels. Groups of chaloupe are
also used against larger ships in boarding actions, due to their ability
to quickly get inside a ship's cannonade.

  - **Wounds:** 100 (Sinking)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Crommesteven

A *crommesteven*, or crumster, is an armed houy developed by the
Varendish, essentially a barge with cannons on it. It is used by navies
to attack enemy positions on land, rather than for ship-to-ship combat.
Like the houy, the crommesteven is not seaworthy and is limited to
operating on lakes, rivers, along the shorelines of oceans.

  - **Wounds:** 400 (Drop 1, Drop 2, Drop 4, Sinking)
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Dame de la Guerre

A *dame de la guerre*, or simply "dame", is a powerful warship. Larger
than a frigate, but built along the same lines, dame has three masts,
each with three or four sails. It was designed to be tough and carry a
lot of cannon, and has such has little cargo room and often cramped crew
quarters as well. It has separate gun deck, and can have as many as 56

### Fregate

A *fregate* is a three-masted, square-rigged fighting ship, designed for
speed and maneuverability and typically carrying lighter armaments.
Fregates are among the first ocean-going military vessels developed.
They are used for naval patrols, as well as to protect larger military
and merchant ships. They have a separate gun deck, where cannon are
operated and powder and shot are stored.

### Galion

Galion means "little ship" in Gallinean, which is ironic, because they
are huge, multi-decked vessels weighing as much as 1,000 tons. A
galion has three or four masts, depending upon its size. Originally
designed as cargo ships, they have vast holds and are incredibly tough,
capable of withstanding violent storms at sea. For this reason they are
valued by privateers and pirates, because they can hold up in a fight,
and some carrying capacity can be given over to more heavy cannon
without losing room for plunder and salvage.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Galley

A *galley* is a larger ship propelled mainly by rowing. They are the
earliest form of warships, originally developed by the Ekalians. Galleys
have 15 or 25 rows of oars, operated by soldiers or slaves seated on
long benches. While no longer used by any of the world's navies, galleys
are still occasionally employed by pirates and slavers, who put their
prisoners to work pulling the oars. Some galleys have also been modified
to operate using clockwork oars, mechanically pulling the ship through
the water.

### Houy

A *houy* is a heavy barge with a single mast, typically used for
hauling heavy freight or passengers. They are used on lakes, rivers and
shallow channels where larger ships cannot go. Houys are not open sea
worthy, but are used by navies as supply ships to carry fresh water,
gunpowder, and other supplies when fleets are traveling along
coastlines.

### Schiff

A *schiff*, or skiff, derived from the old Varendish word for ship, is
a double-ended rowboat. They have no sails, and their bottoms may be
flat or rounded depending upon the depth of the waters in which they are
used. Schiffs are found everywhere, as simple vessels used to cross
lakes and rivers, or aboard larger ships as lifeboats and ship-to-shore
transportation.

### Schooner 

A *schooner* is a ship with two or more masts, and two or more triangular
sails per mast. They were originally developed by the Varendish as
fishing vessels. Schooners have since been adopted as pleasure yachts by
wealthy merchant families, as wells as by those who find speed
essential, including slavers, blockade runners, and privateers.

## Ship Costs

The following table shows the price of buying a sailing ship.

### Ship Operating Costs

Operating a sailing ship costs money. Unless they have been conscripted
against their will, crew members expect to be paid. The cost of employing a crew for a week is
shown on the table below. In addition, the provisions consumed by the crew takes up space;
the amount of cargo space taken up by one week of provisions is shown on the table as well.

If a ship wishes to carry an extra set of sails, they can purchase those at the prices shown
on the table.

Table: Ship Operating Costs

| Ship Type         | Sails Cost | Crew Pay | Provisions Space | 
| :---------------- | :--------: | :------: | :--------------: | 
| Brigantine        | 2D6        | 2D10     |  4               |

:# Free Ship?

Depending on the kind of campaign you're running, you may want to give
your cavaliers access to a ship without paying the costs listed above.

Here are the suggested ship types for various types of campaigns:

Table: Free Ship by Campaign Type

| Campaign Type | Suggested Ship Type                    |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------- |
| Cavalier      | Chaloupe, Brigantine                   |
| Trade         | Schooner                               |
| Military      | Fregate, Brigantine, Dame de la Guerre |
| Exploration   | Galion                                 |
| Piracy        | Schooner                               |

**Cavalier** campaigns are the typical scenario for the *The Queen's Cavaliers* where
the player characters are not sea-based, although a few characters might be. The chaloupe
is a ship directly owned by the Queen's Cavaliers organization that can be loaned to the players,
while the brigantine would be a ship from the Queen's Navy that can be requisitioned for 
specific missions. The players wouldn't need to pay the operation costs listed above.

**Trade** campaigns are described earlier in this chapter. If the players own their own
ship, they have to pay the operational costs, but if they are employed by matron, such as an
Ekalian merchant princess or a Gallinean duchess, then the matron pays for the operating costs.

**Military** campaigns are likewise described earlier; the ship would of course be owned by the
Queen's Navy, who also pay the maintenance costs. The size of the ship depends on the military
ranks of the players and whether there is a player-character captain. 

**Exploration** campaigns may be away from civilization for an extended period of time, and thus
the galion's additional size and speed make for an excellent combination. Because of the 
operating costs, exploration campaigns usually have a sponsor such as a queendom or the Asrian
church.

**Piracy** campaigns assume the player characters own their own ship, and thus raiding for booty becomes
necessary for paying for provisions. A piracy campaign should start with a schooner and the
players should be given the opportunity to trade up by capturing a larger ship such as a brigantine,
fregate, or galion.

## Ship Equipment

Some of the equpiment of most use on a ship are shown below.

Table: Ship Equipment 

| Item                  | Cost              | Item Die                               |
| :-------------------- | :---------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| Drydock               | 2D12              | Clockworks +1D10, repairing ships only |
| Floatweave apparel    | +1D6 or more      |                                        |
| Sailmaking supplies   | 1D8, bulk         |                                        |
| Shipbuilding supplies | 1D8, bulk         |                                        |
| Shipwright's tools    | 1D8               | Clockworks +1D6, repairing ships only  |

- **Drydock:** A drydock is the shipwright's tools version of a workshop. Even less portable than more workshops,
  the drydock requires the ship to be out of the water while being repaired.

- **Floatweave Apparel:** A specialized form of charmwoven material that gives a Charm Die bonus on attempts
  to stay afloat. Only tricornes, doublets, soldier's gloves, or boots can take a floatweave charm, and
  no other charm can be placed on such an item of apparel.

- **Sailmaking Supplies:** Units of sailmaking supplies are used when a ship's sails and rigging are
  repaired. Sailmaking supplies can be created from normal fabric supplies; it takes 9 units of fabric
  to create 1 unit of sailmaking supplies.

- **Shipbuilding Supplies:** Units of shipbuilding supplies are used when hulls, rudders, masts, and other
  parts of a ship are repaired. Each unit of shipbuilding supplies takes up one cargo space on a ship.

- **Shipwright's Tools:** These tools are used to repair a ship, and give an Item Die for repairing a ship.

## Ship-to-Ship Combat

Combat aboard ship runs the same way as regular combat, with two
exceptions. Different players may be making roles for separate actions
of the ship, and the ship itself may automatically provide Advantages
based in its various qualities.

### Initiative

Initiative is rolled by each ship's Capitaine, who can apply any Specialty or other personal Advantages to the roll.

### Actions Before Combat

Any character with the Strategy Skill can roll to try and gain an Advantage. This can be used once during the coming battle.

### Actions in Combat

During ship-to-ship combat, each ship gets one action. The Capitaine of
that ships determines what that action will be, and the player or
players whose characters are responsible for that action make the rolls.
All characters aboard the ship are assumed to be taking their actions
simultaneously, unless they are acting in opposition and individual
Initiative needs to be determined.

#### Attack

Players who are manning cannons all make rolls against their Aim Skill.
As this happens simultaneously, the MJ can ask for results from each
player from left to right.

#### Assist

If more than one character is involved in a "Use a Skill" Action other
than normal Combat actions, but only one roll is required, they may
assist each other.

#### Flourish

Flourish can be used in Ship-to-Ship Combat to pull off impressive
sailing maneuvers and trick shots with the cannon. It cannot be used to
target individual opponent characters to do additional damage, can be
used for dramatic effect. For example, a Flourish can be used with a
cannon attack to knock the opposing Capitaine's hat off, but not to
shoot her directly.

#### Focus

If more than two ships are involved in a Combat, a Capitaine can use Focus to reroll Initiative and change her ship's turn order.

#### Move or Run

Ships use a larger scale of areas than characters do. Each naval area is roughly equal to 
81 normal areas, in a 9 x 9 grid.

While some ships are faster than others on open water, in combat it is
assumed that all ships are moving at similar speeds in order to be able
to attack. As with characters, a ship may Move to an adjacent naval area, or
Run two naval areas away. The only exception is the schiff, which can't Run.

When two ships are within the same naval area, the character at the
helm of each ship much make a simple Explore specialty roll to avoid a collision.
If even one ship fails the roll, both ships suffer 3d12 Wounds.

#### Prepare

Prepare actions are declared by the Capitaine, and often involved waiting for other ships to move into position before firing.

#### Reload

Reloading cannon is a Drop 4 penalty, and is the only thing that can be
done by those characters that round. Cannon crews typically alternate
for this reason, with half the cannon firing while the other half
reloads.

#### Boarding Actions

If two ships are side-by-side at the end of a combat round, any
Capitaine can declare a boarding action. The player assuming the role of
Maîtresse de Voiles must made a simple Explore roll
for the boarding crew to attach the two ships together using ropes, opposed by
the Explore roll of the character at the opposing ship's helm. If the latter
wins, then the boarding action isn't successful.

Once the ships are attached and the boarding action is under way,
ship-to-ship combat ends and individual combat between characters
begins.

## Seafaring Hazards

There are many hazards that characters will face aboard ship.

### Drowning

Should a character fall overboard into the open ocean, make a simple Explore roll.
The MJ will make an opposed roll with a difficulty determined by
the water's conditions. A calm sea in warm weather might be an easy
roll, while falling in during a roiling sea in the black of night will
prove far more challenging.

For each round that a drowning character remains in the water, she takes
a point of Yield. When she reaches her Yield Limit, the character is
unconscious and begins taking Wounds. When she reaches her Wound limit,
the character has been claimed by the sea.

### Falling Overboard

Ships are thrown about at the mercy of the ocean, and may pitch wildly.
If standing close to the rail, there is a danger of a character falling
overboard. Make a Defense or Explore roll, with a difficulty determined by the MJ
based on the violence with which the vessel is being tossed. The MJ
makes an opposed roll. Use the Non-Combat Skills table to determine the
specific outcome, but a character who fails falls into the water and may
risk Drowning (above).

### Fire

Any time a ship has been hit with cannon during battle, there is a
chance of fire breaking out. Roll a d12, and on a roll of 1 or 2 a fire
has started. These always begin small, doing d4 damage to the vessel.
For each round the fire is unattended and not dealt with, the damage
spreads to one additional area and increases by 1 die (d6 to d8, d8 to
d10, d10 to d12). Each area of fire will spread, and each must be put
out separately.

### Navigation

Staying the course can be a difficult task. At the start of each sea
voyage, the player character filling the roll of the Navigateur should
make a Calculus roll to determine whether the ship will
arrive at the desired destination in the expected amount of time. This
roll can then be made daily to insure the ship is still on course, and
so that course corrections can be made as needed.

Additional navigation rolls should be made whenever an event occurs
that could throw the ship off course. This includes extreme weather,
combat, and encounters with sea monster.

### Clouds, Fog, and Mist 

Impaired visibility can mean the sun
cannot be seen by day, nor the stars by night. This makes checking your
position next to impossible, and navigation a matter of the best guess.
Make a check for each day or partial day that the ship is sailing
through conditions of poor visibility.

### Combat

In the open ocean, when you're concerned with either
coming along side your opponent or fleeing from them, it's easy to lose
track of where you are and what direction you're headed. A navigation
roll should be made following any ship-to-ship combat action to plot
the course anew.

### Doldrums

The doldrums are low-pressure areas where the
prevailing winds are not particularly strong. This makes sails
effectively useless, and leaves the ship to the mercy of any currents.
Doldrums can last for several days. For each day spent without benefit
of sails, make a navigation roll.

### Storms

A violent storm can toss a ship about and throw it
wildly off course. Often the Capitaine and crew are preoccupied with
keeping the ship from being torn apart and lose awareness of their
position and heading. Following an encounter with a storm, make a
navigation roll to reestablish the course.

### Visible Shoreline

Navigation theoretically becomes easier
when you can see the shore and utilize known landmarks. The tradeoff is
that waters become more shallow and the possibility of running aground
increases. When sailing along a shoreline make a navigation roll with a
+1D8 bonus die to determine the course, but also make an Explore roll at a Drop 2
penalty to avoid shallows, hidden reefs, and sand bars.

### Reefs, Sandbars, and Sargassum

On a failed navigation roll in shallow waters, the vessel may run
aground on reefs or sandbars. In all sorts of waters, a ship might also
run afoul of sargassum, a free-floating seaweed that an ensnare a ship
and foul her rudders. To free a grounded ship will take 10 crew members
working full-time a total of 10 days. For each additional 10 crew
members working on the problem, reduce the time by a day. No roll is
needed to achieve this.

## Storms

One consequence of a failed navigation roll may be that the ship sails
into a storm. It's also possible that your MJ may introduce a storm simply
to add drama to your seafaring adventure. As a force of nature, a storm
requires no attack rolls, and simply does damage to a ship for each hour
it remains in the storm. This is measured in a number of d12s. A
navigation roll can be made to get the ship free after the first hour.

Table: Storm Categories

| Winds        | Wind Speed | Waves   | Damage |
| :----------  | :--------: | :-----: | :----: |
| Minimal      |  80 mph    |   5 ft. | 1d12   |
| Moderate     | 100 mph    |  10 ft. | 2d12   |
| Extensive    | 120 mph    |  15 ft. | 2d12   |
| Extreme      | 140 mph    |  20 ft. | 4d12   |
| Catastrophic | 160 mph    | +25 ft. | +5d12  | 

Storms do not do damage to characters, but anyone above deck runs the
risk of Falling Overboard and Drowning (see above).

## Seafaring Creatures

Pirates and enemy navies aren't the only opponents that seafaring
adventurers may encounter. The following creatures are large enough to
threaten ships, and are these presented with statistics as if they were
ships.

### Ghost Ships

There are legends of ships whose crew have been claimed by the sea, yet
denied the eternal rest of death. These ships sail only at night,
descending back into the depths by day. They glow with an eerie light,
and both vessel and crew are unexpectedly tangible, and prey upon unwary
ships with no seeming rhyme or reason.

For a ghost ship, use statistics of the appropriate ship type. Double
the crew in order to reflect additional lost souls taken aboard her. Add
the Yield to the ship's Wounds, and reduce Yield to 0 as it is
impossible to foul a ghost ship's rigging.

  - **Speed:** 300 leagues

  - **Wounds:** 900
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Kraken

The kraken is a type of giant squid, found mainly in the colder waters
of the Sea of Albia and around the Northern Storm Islands. They reach
their tentacles up out of the ocean and wrap them around a ship,
attempting to pull it down into the depths as their tremendous beaks
rend holes in the hull.

The tentacles of a kraken can attack characters in deck independently,
and indeed this has saved many a ship from destruction. So long as the
tentacles are engaged, they cannot be attaching to the ship and puller
her down. If a kraken manages to get all 8 tentacles wound around the
ship, over her decks and through her rigging, the ship will sink the
following round. The other saving grace is that once a kraken has the
ship, it loses interest in the crew, who may swim, or grab onto debris,
or fall back to any life boats, with no further threat from the horrid
beast.

### Sea Serpent

These gargantuan water snakes are found everywhere, from open seas to
large, freshwater lakes. They seem attracted by movement, and will
attack any vessel that draws their interest. Their typical mode is to
rear their head up out of the water and strike at any motion on the deck
they see, whether it be sailors, flapping sails, or the rigging.

### Schurke

The word *schurke* in Varendish means a villain or scoundrel, and was
applied to human beings before this great fish was first encountered.
The first thing spotted will be their great dorsal fin, rising out of
the water and marking their approach. They will then ram a ship, trying
to knock its crew into the water. Failing that, they will then attempt
to take bites out of the hull, and swallow any humans or livestock
aboard.

### Whales

Great, white, square-headed mammals, these animals are peaceful, and
travel in groups of up to 10. They are sometimes hunted for their meat,
while their fat makes excellent oil and their bones are utilized in a
variety of decorative arts. Whiles can become fearsomely defensive when
hunted. An injured whale will often go mad, ramming ships without
provocation and creating a grim hazard.

## Seafaring Charms

Charms are not the exclusive domain of land-dwellers. Craftsmen often
instill a ship's accoutrements with charms that aid in her operation and
protection. These magicks are often attuned to the Capitaine, but may
also be aligned with members of the crew to aid them in the performance
of their duties.

### Charmwoven Flags

Like apparel, Charmwoven Flags are attuned to only one person, the
ship's Capitaine. A naval officer may fly the flag of her nation, but
each will have subtle differences, and she will take that banner with
her when she changes ships. Pirate Capitaines have individual flags,
typically depicting skulls or skeletons, but unique to them. The colors
of the flag limit the types of charms. To have Guile charms, for
example, the flag must contain cendree, purpure, sable, or sanguine.

Each flag provides the Capitaine a bonus to one Specialty, which must be
related to their operation of the ship. Common charms are for Aim,
Intuition, Perceive, and Strategy.

### Charmwoven Sails 

Sails may be charmwoven, and are attuned to the Capitaine or, more
often, the Maîtresse de Voiles. The difference between Charmwoven Sails
and Charmwoven apparel is that the bonuses apply not just to the
individual they are attuned to, but to anyone acting under orders of or
on behalf of that person. This means that any crew member operating the
rigging under orders from the Maîtresse de Voiles can apply that bonus
to their Specialty.

Charmwoven sails may be dyed in accordance with the nature of their
charms, or embroidered with an appropriately colored thread. This makes
their appearance distinct, leading to some ships to adopt colored sails
simply to present the appearance that they may be charmwoven. They do
not all need to be the same color, simply in alignment. Affinity charms
on a 2-masted ship may have one set of sails that are carnation, and
another murrey.

All the sails of a ship must be imbued with the same charm; a 3-masted
ship cannot have three separate charms in play. Typical charms include
Dodge, Inspire, Strategy, and Timing. Base cost for sails and
rigging is 1D6 per mast. Charm costs are the same as those listed for
Charmwoven Apparel.

### Charmforged Cannon

Being made of iron, cannons are not so much charmwoven as charmforged.
They are cast with precious and semi-precious stones embedded in them,
and with symbols cast into their bodies. Cannon are attuned to one
person, often the Maîtresse d\'Armes à Feu if not the Capitaine herself.
As with charmwoven sails, the bonuses of charmed cannon are conferred to
those who are acting under orders of those to whom they are attuned.
These bonuses only extend to that specific cannon, not a battery of
cannon, unless all of the cannon in that battery have been charmforged.

Cannon are almost exclusively charmed with one Specialty: Blackpowder. While it
does not affect the magic, charmforged cannon are often painted,
lacquered, or enameled in the colors of Affinity Charms, carnation,
celeste, murrey, tenne, and vert, to distinguish them from ordinary
cannon.

### Charmcarved Figureheads

It would be expensive and tedious work to try to charm the entire hull
of a ship. For that reason, figureheads on the prow of the ship were
created, to provide protection as well as ornamentation. These
figureheads are often carved into the likenesses of legendary persons or
mythical creatures.

Unlike other charms, figureheads are attuned to the ship itself and the
bonuses may be used by any member of the crew. The figure is typically
portrayed as clothed in the color most appropriate to the charm.
Birthstones used correspond to the date the ship was first launched.
Common specialties include Deceive, Dodge, Inspire, Intuition,
Negotiate, Perceive, and Vigilance.

## Clockwork Chandlery

While the operation of a ship is largely the result of wind, water, and
human endeavor, there are a select number of clockworks commonly
employed to assist in those tasks.

Table: Clockwork Chandlery

| Item           | Cost | Item Die                        |
| :------------- | :--: | :------------------------------ |
| Chronometer    | d12  | Calculus +1D10, navigation only | 
| Clockwork Oars | d10  |                                 |
| Compass        |  d6  | Calculus +1D6, navigation only  |
| Sextant        |  d8  | Calculus +1D8, navigation only  |
| Screws         | d12  |                                 |

### Chronometer

A chronometer is a device used to help determine longitude, a ship's
east-to-west location on a nautical chart or map. The information from a
sextant aids in navigation rolls to determine precise location and plot
courses.

### Clockwork Oars

Some galleys have been refitted with clockwork devices that operate the
oars. The oars are attached to a long metal bar, which in turn is
mounted to a flywheel at the front of the rowing deck. The motion of the
flywheel moves the bars back and forth, pulling the oars without the
need for human labor.

### Compass

A compass is a device that can determine directions, its needle always
pointing north. It is used as an aid in navigation as well as by those
at the helm of the ship.

### Sextant

A sextant is a measuring device used to determine latitude, the
north-to-south location of a vessel on a nautical chart or map. It
measures the angle between a celestial object, such as the sun or a
star, and the horizon. It is used to help perform celestial navigation,
determine current location, and plot courses.

### Screws

A ship's screws are a clockwork device used to propel the ship without
sails. They are used primarily on smaller, riverbound vessels, although
some larger vessels have them as an emergency measure to avoid being
stuck in the doldrums. Screws consist or two or more circular metal
blades mounted aft of the ship below the waterline. They are attached to
a clockwork mechanism on the inside of the ship, which causes the screws
to turn. The motion of the screws displaces the water, forcing the
vessel to move forward.
