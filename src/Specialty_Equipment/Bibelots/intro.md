# Bibelots {.cbreakbefore}

Bibelots are trinkets created by using the Portents specialty, meant to ward off bad luck or
malicious hexes.
These are created with the Magicks (Portents) specialty<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection">Crafting</a>.
Bibelots are often crafted from glass, copper, pottery, carved gems, or leaves.

Each bibelot is tied to one specific skill, such as Defense or Dueling. Cursory examination of a bibelot
is enough to let anyone competent in Magicks identify its associated skill.

You use a bibelot by wearing it on your person, in contact with your skin, although it doesn't need to
be openly displayed. You can only wear one bibelot at a time; touching a second bibelot with your bare
skin causes the first one to shatter. You can carry additional bibelots as long as you don't touch them;
for example, in a pocket or belt pouch.

A bibelot is used under one of two circumstances:

  - If someone tries to cast a hex on you that affects the associated skill
  - If you make roll for an associated specialty and roll a 1 on one of the dice in the pool

In the first case, the bibelot shatters and the hex doesn't take effect.
In the second case, you can *choose* to use the bibelot; if you do, the bibelot shatters and you
can roll 1D6 to replace the result of 1.

Whenever a bibelot shatters, you can feel it; it's against your skin, after all. It doesn't wound
you, but you do gain 1 point of yield.

If you have ranks in the Magicks (Portents) specialty, you can wear an additional number of bibelots
equal to your specialty ranks. However, you can't wear more than one bibelot for any given skill. For example,
if you have +2 ranks in Magicks (Portents), you can wear one bibelot for Defense and another for Dueling, but
not two for Dueling.

Getting out a bibelot and wearing it is a Drop 3 action. Most readers of Portents will carry extra bibelots in a
padded case or pouch.
