# Charmweaving

"Clothes make the woman," or so the old Lutetian maxim claims. Certainly
this is true in Gallinea's capital city as well as the rest of Elara;
fashion is a tangible thing in Gallinea.

Charmweaving, which originated in Lutetia, is the practice of adding
specific dyes, trinkets, threads, and other magickal enhancements to
articles of clothing. These enhancements provide bonuses to specific
tasks.
