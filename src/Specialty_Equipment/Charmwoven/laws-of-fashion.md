# The Nine Laws of Fashion

Charmwoven clothes are useful, stylish, and expensive, but they are also
made according to exacting standards known as Gallinea's Nine Laws of
Fashion. Flouting these laws could lead to your Charms simply failing to
work at all !

While these are known as "Gallinea's" Laws, that's not because they're
enforced by the Queen's decree or by some sort of "fashion police" that
stalks the streets of Lutetia. Instead, these are akin to natural Laws
that were first noticed and codified in Gallinea; they simply describe
how things are rather than how they should be.

The First is the simplest Law:

## The First Law: The Law of Couture

*"One's clothes must fit properly."*

It seems obvious at first -- clothing is meant to be worn and to fit
properly ! But it's also the most important. If your clothes aren't
sized correctly for you, none of the charms will function. In addition,
each off-size article of clothing you wear adds a Drop 1 penalty to
combat actions if it's too large or too small.

To ensure your clothes are properly sized, you can't just buy your
clothes off the rack; the people of Gallinea are a diverse group when it
comes to body size, and there are no "standard sizes". Your clothes will
need to be either be created specifically for you, or altered by a
tailor. Only then can charms be effectively added to such apparel.

## The Second Law: The Law of Attunement

*"Charms are unique to the wearer."*

You can't just pick up any random charmwoven item and put it on, even if
it fits you. The patterns, glyphs, and trinkets sewn into charmwoven
clothing have to be calibrated for each wearers. This is a pretty simple
process -- as long as the charmweaver knows your birth date, birth time,
and place of birth. It usually takes about an hour to attune or reattune
charms to any given person.

What if you don't know some or any of that information to tell your
charmweaver? There are two options.

First, your charmweaver can attempt to adjust the charms to you anyway,
through trial and error. This takes one hour per piece of information
about your birth that you're missing. At the end of that process, the
charmweaver makes a simple Magicks (Weave) roll with the opposition pool
based on how much they don't know, as shown on the following
table.

Table: Opposition Pool for Charm Attunement Rolls

| Die | Birth Date           | Birth Time          | Place of Birth           |
| --- | :------------------- | :------------------ | :----------------------- |
| D0  | Exact date           | Time, to the minute | City or village of birth |
| D6  | Year and month known | Time, to the hour   | Province of birth        |
| D8  | Month known          | Morning or Night    | Country of birth         |
| D10 | Year known           |  --                 | Continent of birth       |
| D12 | Nothing known        | Nothing known       | Nothing known            |

The dice pool is based on all of these factors -- so if you know the
exact date of your birth, that you know you were born in the morning,
and that you were born somewhere in Talania, that's an opposition pool
of 1D0+1D8+1D8, or 2D8. As it's a simple check, the charmweaver needs
just one success point to correctly attune the item. On a failed check,
the charmweaver needs to start over again to attune the item.

The second option involves the use of Magicks (Portents), and for this
reason many charmweavers either work with those who can read omens, or
can do so themselves. 

The opposition pool for the Portents roll is the same as the pool
calculated above for the trial-and-error method using the Magicks
(Weave) specialty, but this is a standard roll not a simple roll. It
takes one minute to perform this type of reading, the portent-reader
must see you the entire time, and you must be willing to have it done.
Each success point spent reveals either your birth date, your birth time
to the minute, or your city or village of birth.

## The Third Law: The Law of Pertinence

*"The charm must correspond to the article."*

Simply stated, this means that a charm can only be applied to an item
that has some relationship to the type of enchantment desired.

For example, gloves for soldiers can be given charms that assist with
Dueling or Military (Aim), while gloves for craftsmen can be charmed for
Magicks, Medicine, or Science.

Pertinent skills for any given type of clothing are found later in this chapter

which also summarizes which types of charms can be applied to which pieces of attire.

## The Fourth Law: The Law of Dissonance

*"Dissonance limits the effectiveness of charms."*

*description of dissonance needed*

| Dissonance Level | Maximum Charm Die |
| :--------------- | :---------------- |
| 0                | No limits         |
| 1                | 1D12              |
| 2                | 1D10              |
| 3                | 1D8               |
| 4                | 1D6               |
| 5                | 1D0               |
| 6 or more        | None              |

## The Fifth Law: The Law of Cacophony

*explanation needed*

## The Seventh Law: The Law of Darning

*"Rips, tears, and holes produce dissonance."*

*explanation needed*

| Unrepaired Rips | Dissonance |
| :-------------- | :--------- |
| 0               |  +0        |

## The Eighth Law: The Law of Station

*"Outfits of mismatched attire produce dissonance."*

*explanation needed*

Mismatched refers to the social rank associated with each item.
Predefined outfits automatically count as a single rank.
