Each device consists of the following:

- 1 Casing
- 1 or more Power Sources
- 1 or more Components

::::::::::::::::::::::: gamestats :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
**Gear Space:** Each casing has a certain amount of gear space available,
depending upon its size. The power source and the components use up that
space once installed. A miniaturization component can be installed in a
casing to increase its effective gear space.

**Power:** Each power source delivers a set amount of power, dependent on
the type of power source and the method of producing that power. Each
component consumes a specified amount of power, and the power source's
output must be enough to cover the power used by the components. Power
is measured in power units.

**Complexity:** The complexity of a device is equal to the number of power
sources plus the number of components.
