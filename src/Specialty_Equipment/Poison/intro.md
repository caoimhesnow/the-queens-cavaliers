# Poisons {.cbreakbefore}

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: gamestats ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Poisons in *The Queen's Cavaliers* are tracked in the abstract, without
having to choose a specific poison type until you use it. For example,
you may have 6 vials of poison, and when you use lethal poison, you
mark off a vial of poison and now have 5.

The exception is an exotic poison, which must be designated at the time it is purchased.

The Magicks (Brew) skill can be used to create vials of poison, as described []{.comingsoon}

Table: Standard Poisons

| Lethal      | Cause death          | Inflict wounds                                    |
| Nausea      | Queasy stomach       | Drop penalty on Medicine, Etiquette, Brew         |
| Perplexity  | Brain fogginess      | Drop penalty on Science, Scholarship              |
| Temerarious | Poor impulse control | Drop penalty on Parry, Block, Etiquette, Strategy |
| Verity      | Truth serum          | Drop penalty on Deceive, Banter                   |
| Vertigo     | Dizziness            | Drop penalty on Dodge, Aim                        |

### Success Table Additions

Each type of poison adds an option to a success table. If the poison is applied to a 
weapon such as knife or a bow and arrows, the option is added to Dueling (Lunge), Dueling (Riposte),
Dueling (Feint), or Military (Aim). If the poison is delivered by being ingested, the option
is added to the Medicine (Poison) roll.

### Repeated Applications

If a poison causes a Drop penalty, the victim is only affected by later applications of
the same poison if the new Drop penalty exceeds the old one. For example, if the first use of
Vertigo gives a Drop 2 penalty, subsequent uses on the same victim must cause at least
a Drop 3 penalty or they have no effect. If the second use causes a Drop 1 penalty, it
doesn't add to the Drop 2.

### Identifying Poison Effects

The effects of every type of poison are apparent when they take effect, but attributing the
effect to a poison and not some other cause requires a simple Medicine (Poison) knowledge
roll. The Standard Opposition against such a roll is 3D6 if you are the victim or can
fully communicate with the victim, 3D8 if you can only observe the victim, and 3D10 if the
victim is unconscious or dead.

## Antidotes

Poison antidote is general-use and can be used against any type of
standard poison. It's ineffective against exotic poisons, such as
yellow-bellied scorpion venom. For those, a specific antidote for
each exotic poison is needed.

Poisons are typically used by adding them to food, by injecting them into an unsuspecting victim,
or by stabbing someone with a poisoned knife.
