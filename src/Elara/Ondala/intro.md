The island nation of Ondala lies off the southwest coast of Gallinea,
across the Ondalan Channel. Ondala was originally settled by the old
Qartan Empire, and the Ondalans view themselves as the true inheritors
of the Qartan golden age.

The city of Cordera is the head of worship of the Goddess-Empress Asria
(also known as Ashra and Eserre), and home to the Matriarch, the leader
of the church hierarchy. Faithful Chaplains from all of Elara come to
Cordera to train in the Holy College before returning to their home
countries for ministry. Other religions are officially banned within
Ondala.

Over the years, Ondala has been at war with Gallinea, Ekalia, and Albia,
but is currently in a time of relative peace with its neighbors. Most
conflicts arise over their aggressive colony, New Cordera, in West Ifran
and its conflicts with its neighbors.

Like Gallinea, Ondala is a matriarchy; Queen Ximena IV has held the
throne for nearly 40 years, and has been known for her many liaisons
with young women and men of the court. Her power is limited by the
edicts of the Church under the direction of the current Matriarch,
Isabine de la Justicia.
