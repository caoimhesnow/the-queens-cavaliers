## Talanian Clockworks

The toysmiths of Talania have perfected the ability to work at minuscule
size, producing tiny clockwork devices and components. These are highly
valued by collectors in Gallinea and elsewhere -- at least, if they date
before the Shattering Frost. Newer devices are made with just as much
skill, but the talents of contemporary refugee clockworkers are not
valued in most of Elara.

| Item                | Cost   | Type                   |
| :------------------ | :----: | :--------------------- |
| Arcanimation Engine | Varies | Clockwork power supply |
| Harmonicon          | Varies | Clockwork component    |

### Arcanimation Engine

Comprised of charms and clockworks woven together in a cloth-driven
miniature turbine, arcanimation engines are the preferred power source
for most Talanian micro-devices. (Mainsprings are a far second.)

An arcanimation engine provides just a tiny amount of power, but it's
enough to run the types of lower-power clockworks found in toys and
dolls. An arcanimation engine supplies power for one hour, then the
charms shut down to recover that power back over the next six hours.
After six hours, the arcanimation engine can provide power again.

The power supplied by an arcanimation engine can be only be used to run
Articulation, Calculation, Carry, Efficiency, Harmonicon, Measurement,
Miniaturization, or Movement components. In addition, the specific
components powered can be no larger than 1 gear space each.

Creating an Arcanimation Engine: The Magicks (Weave) and Science
(Clockworks) specialties are both required to create an arcanimation
engine. You are limited by your lowest rank number of each specialty, as
shown on the table
below.

Table: Arcanimation Engines

| Space | Cost (Gears, Fabric) | Minimum Ranks           | Power Supplied |
| :---: | :------------------: | :---------------------- | :------------: |
| 1     | D0 (1, 1)            | Clockworks +1, Weave +1 | 1              |
| 1     | D6 (1, 1)            | Clockworks +2, Weave +2 | 2              |
| 1     | D8 (1, 1)            | Clockworks +3, Weave +3 | 3              |
| 1     | D10 (1, 1)           | Clockworks +4, Weave +4 | 4              |
| 1     | D12 (1, 1)           | Clockworks +5, Weave +5 | 5              |

### Harmonicon

A harmonicon component plays predefined music when activated. A more
complex harmonicon can play more than one composition, and a Computation
component can be added for even more advanced music generation.

**Instrument Types:** A harmonicon can include the following types of
instruments: idiophones (percussion instruments), lamellophones (jaw
harps and music boxes), membranophones (drums), chordophones (string
instruments and harpsichords), and aerophones (wind instruments).
Harmonicons can't reproduce human voices or any kind of speech.

**Creating a Harmonicon Component:** The Culture (Arts) and Science
(Clockworks) specialties are both required to create a harmonicon. You
are limited by your lowest rank number of each specialty, as shown on
the table below.
