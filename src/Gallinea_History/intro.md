# History of Gallinea 

Gallinea is a proud nation with a long history going back over two thousand years. Originally
occupied by a people known as the *Brigue*, the lush farmlands and towering mountains of
Gallinea later were conquered and colonized by the Qartan Empire. When that empire fell, as
all do, the following centuries saw the former Qartan marches coming together to create a
Gallinean queendom.
