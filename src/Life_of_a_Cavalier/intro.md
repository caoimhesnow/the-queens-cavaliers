# The Life of a Cavalier 

[Bonus Content by Sam Chupp]{.bonuscontent}

These two storylines are designed to be dropped in to any existing campaign of *The Queen’s
Cavaliers.*

## Introduction

### What Players Want
Regardless of whether your players choose their characters abilities or randomly generate them,
most players want to contribute to the story and to have their character take their share of action.
Because of the wide range of skills and abilities that Queen’s Cavaliers may have, it is important
that you, as the MJ, choose to “play to their strengths,” to involve them and their character’s skills
in the planning of your story. You would do well to examine who has chosen what Specialty
under each Competency, maybe even make a note for yourself so that you may better tailor the
story to match the Cavaliers’ skills.

### A Note About Multi­directional versus Linear Plots

It is not the goal for this adventure to be linear, start­to­finish. The players should have the last
word as to what their characters will do. The beauty of this approach, however, is that in your
mind the story that is written down in these pages will continue to flow as they do other things. It
is important that you insert sections of this story into the events of the daily lives of the Cavaliers.

For example, let’s say they refuse to go search the scene of the first theft. That’s fine. Just
have them “overhear” two NPCs discussing the amazing nature of that scene within their
earshot.

Whatever you do, don’t force them into anything. There are always duties the Cavaliers may be
doing, and if they don’t want to follow along with the story you have prepared, you can keep them
interested and engaged by rolling with the punches and making sure you know what your
storyline is doing when they aren’t around!

### When In Doubt, Swashbuckle

*The Queen’s Cavaliers* is a game about swashbuckling. Action. Intrigue. Romance. So
whenever possible, insert these elements into your storylines. Keeping the action moving and
keeping the energy up will fulfill the promise of the game and make things easier on you, the MJ.

If the Cavalier who is a Mechanician wants to spend 4 hours working on a new device, let her,
but then turn to the Courtier and say, “Well, what are you doing with those hours?” In this
scenario, a Courtier could go and find out gossip from a noble friend, enjoy a cup of wine in her
favorite wine­shop (where a belligerent soldier is bothering a newly minted Chaplain) and your
Courtier may have to step in to deal with it. Or manipulate another Cavalier into doing it! The
point is the focus should always be Action, Intrigue, and Romance.

## Storyline: To Catch a Thief {.breakbefore}

The theme of the first story, “To Catch a Thief”, is “things are not always what they seem” as
well as “there’s always someone sneakier than you.” The Queen’s Cavaliers will meet their
match and a worthy foe. The Viscountess Magdalene LaBeau, who is secretly the extremely
accomplished jewel thief called “La Chatte Noir," the Shadow Cat. La Chatte Noir could be a
long term antagonist for your Cavaliers. The Viscountess has so many options available to her,
and her base is sufficiently large that she can continue to challenge your Cavaliers as they gain
in ability.

### A Brief Overview Of The Truth

La Chatte Noir is actually the Viscountess Magdalene LaBeau. A very wealthy woman who got
that way through investing her inheritance, Viscountess LaBeau is what is known as a “Mother of
Delight,” that is to say, she is wedded to her parties and her fetes, rather than to any other
person. As a result, although many wish invitations to her parties, most do not take her seriously.
Of course, this is just exactly how she likes it! If they knew the cunning mind behind those sultry,
hedonistic eyes, the Cat of Shadows may soon be dwelling in LaRoche, not given the run of the
streets of Lutetia!

Another protection for Viscountess LaBeau is that she is a regular patron of jewelers in Gallinea.
She has made a reputation for herself buying jewels at auction, commissioning grand jewelry,
rings, bracelets, and other items as gifts for her friends and the Queen. Not long ago she made a
very big splash in local gossip when she purchased a beautiful Ondalan Ruby pendant. In fact,
the average observer would believe she has more to fear from the Cat of Shadows than anyone!

No one knows why the Cat of Shadows does what she does. The City Watch believes that she
must have a fence out of town where she sells her famous jewelry. Little do they know that all of
the stolen jewels are currently on display in a deep, cave­like room she calls her Petite Gallery.
She steals not for the money, but for the sheer artistry of it, the thrill of it, and the challenge. And
that is the greatest reason why she has not yet been discovered.

**Description:** 5’6”, 160, scarlet hair laden with natural curls, emerald eyes, milky complexion with freckles.

As Shadow Cat, she is never far from a loyal Cat’s Paw, who will have similar characteristics as
a “Grizzled Veteran” Stock Character, and she has been known to manipulate rabble into
attacking pursuers so she can make good her escape.

:# Cat’s Paws

Shadow Cat has made it a point as she’s gone on through her life to secure for herself allies that
are extremely well disposed to her. These are people whose life she has saved, or who owe her
a debt of honor that can never be repaid. These people are invariably loyal to her, and she calls
them her Cat’s Paws. She is fiercely protective of them, and has gone far to spring them from
prison, rescue them from those who wished them harm, and defend them.

It is, however, not a coincidence that these Cat’s Paws are in positions that are very useful to
her. This is how she stays one step ahead of the Watch, and how she stays out of LaRoche.

**Special Rule:** If the Shadow Cat is ever found without a Cat's Paw nearby, she can make an
Inspiration roll and for every two success points she spends, a Cat's Paw will arrive in 5
rounds. Each additional success point she spends reduces this time by 1 round (minimum of 1 round).
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Rumors and Innuendo
To begin this storyline, you can seed the following rumors and innuendo into the everyday lives of
your Cavaliers. Get them to roll Streetwise (Carouse) checks and see if they can “Learn
Common Rumor” or “Learn Rare Rumor”.

 - The City Watch is very upset because of a series of very daring burglaries that have
   taken place ever since the winter weather broke. Expensive jewelry and priceless
   heirlooms have been taken and the Watch seems powerless to stop it! (Common rumor, true)

 - Household guards of the Comtesse Gurlois Balmains were found asleep on the grounds
   the morning after her famous Lirien Rose pendant was stolen ­ one of three Lirien Roses
   ever created. (Rare rumor, true)

 - A black chalk outline of a pouncing cat was found at every burglary scene ­ people
   believe that this is the mark of La Chatte Noir, the Cat of the Shadows. This thief seems
   unstoppable. Where will she strike next? (Rare rurmor, true)

 - Prince-Consort Carolus is starting to regret sending back to Albia for his favorite jewels,
   which are due to arrive any day before Midsummer. Will La Chatte Noir attack and steal
   the Albian Sapphires which have been in the consort’s family for centuries? (Rare rumor, true)

### The Plot Thickens
Here are some scenes to point out the nature of the character called The Shadow Cat:

#### Don't Leave Me Hanging

The Cavaliers come upon a member of the Lutetia Town Watch, tied up and suspended in an
alleyway. Apparently she was chasing La Chatte Noir, and was captured by a snare the
Cat had set up ahead of time just for that purpose. The Town Watch will be most likely
grateful to be rescued and might tell the Cavaliers more about what she saw.

  - Observation (Deduce) in this case can reveal a powder residue of black chalk from the
    Shadow’s special sigil, or some small red silk fibers from her famous velvet cloak lining.
  - Science (Clockworks) or Science (Calculate)  will be needed to get the watchwoman safely to the
    ground. If the watchwoman makes it to the ground without taking harm, then make sure
    the players receive a rumor for their trouble.

#### The Cat's Out of the Bag

Shadow Cat is (supposedly) apprehended by a clever ruse on the part of Captain Chivan
of the Town Watch, and the Cavaliers have the job of transporting her to La Roche Prison. When
they open the door to the prison cart, instead of the notorious burglar they find a drunken
old sailor, asleep in the vermillion­lined cloak reputed to be favored by the Shadow Cat.
The sailor is innocent, just a hapless drunkard who’d fallen asleep after a night of drinking.

  - An Interaction (Negotiate) skill might get the players off the hook, otherwise they will lose
    some valuable hours being “debriefed” by the Watch Captain.
  - Streetwise (Carouse) can be used to confirm the sailor's identity.
  - Magicks (Weave) can confirm the cloak only appears to be charmwoven, and is not attuned to
    the drunken sailor or anyone else.

#### Climbing the Walls

One of the hallmarks of the Chatte Noir is that she never kills unless absolutely forced to
do so. The Cavaliers discover a big, brawny guard splayed out on the street, completely
unconscious. Apparently she took in a noseful of some kind of sleeping powder, and
passed out. When the guard rushes to the door she should have been guarding, she
discovers a priceless painting missing, a discolored spot on the wall where it once hung.
The truly amazing thing about this, however, is that she had to climb over a nearly
priceless golden cupid figurine to get to it! Clearly, the Cat of Shadows does not steal just
for money!

  - Observation (Perceive) and Observation (Deduce) are very useful here, as is Medicine
    (Poison), to clear the name of the guard, or at the very least induce her to assisting the
    Cavaliers.

And So On…

The Chatte Noir wishes to keep poking at the players’ characters, but doing so in a way that
does not specifically incriminate her. The players may decide that this whole Shadow Cat plotline
is not that important, and focus on other things. Do not be dismayed! Simply keep the Cat in the
background, popping out from behind corners, showing up where the players least expect her.
Sooner or later, one of them will decide to turn the tables and seek her arrest. When this
happens, go to "Catch Me If You Can."

### Catch Me If You Can

If the Cavaliers decide to take on the quest of finding La Chatte Noir, they will discover a most
puissant opponent. More importantly, she is more than a little arrogant. She will do all that she
may to pique the Cavaliers, poke and prod at them to throw them off their game. This is perhaps
her most dangerous aspect, because she finds the risks so delightful. If the Shadow Cat is to
ever truly be caught, it will most likely be because of her overwhelming confidence.
Of course, such audacity serves her in good stead as well. Few have a bright enough mind to
understand her game.

Here’s a list of the sort of things she might try in order to goad the Cavaliers into chasing her.
Note that each example has a suggested skill check, but these are not specifically required. We
want the Cavaliers to discover the clues they’re receiving. The skill checks are to help engage
the players and give you an opportunity to provide them with either further complications or a
special leap of logic that will benefit them.
  - Writing them a perfumed note congratulating them on their efforts thus far. The perfume
    will be something exotic and hard to obtain in Gallinea. Magicks (Brew) to understand this.

  - Sending a street vendor to deliver a present of a small pie, fruit, or other thoughtful
    comestible, telling them it is from Madame Noir. Streetwise (Larceny) or Streetwise (Larceny) 
    to try and gain a description of the one who paid for it. The description is one of the Cat's
    Paws, not le Chatte Noir herself.

  - Leaving a glass of their favorite vintage wine at the scene of a crime they’re investigating.
    Streetwise (Carouse) to notice, and then Observation (Deduce) to try and figure out
    where the wine was obtained. Most likely, it will be from the Cavalier’s favorite wine shop.

  - Having a box of catnip delivered to the Cavalier’s barracks “for encouragement in your
    endeavor.” Streetwise (Larceny) or Culture (Etiquette) to try and find out who delivered
    the box.

  - The Cavaliers meet a fortuneteller who offers to speak their fortune. A fairly accurate
    reading is given, but at the very end the fortuneteller turns over a hand­painted card that
    shows a black cat escaping ­ not part of the standard set of cards! Magicks (Portents) can
    confirm this to be true. The fortuneteller denies all knowledge of how that card got into the deck. Observation (Deduce) will reveal
    the deck contains 13 such “escaping cat” cards. Practical­minded sorts might find the
    fortune­teller’s original deck discarded in an adjacent alleyway with an Observation (Deduce).

All of these are ways that tension can be added to the story and the Cavaliers may learn more about their quarry.

### Meanwhile: The Tears of the Sky

Prince-Consort Carolus, for his own reasons (though the rumor is that he’s concerned that
Crown Prince Edmund might gamble them away) has decided to bring The Tears of the Sky,
priceless sapphire jewels, from their home in Albia. These are beautiful sapphire jewels that have been
passed down to the second born of each family for over a century, and they are priceless to him.
In order to get the jewels to Lutetia safely, the Prince-Consort has conceived of a plan that is as
devious as it is complicated.

Three identical coaches carrying three identical chests will be dispatched from the port city.
Each will have an armed guard of Cavaliers, soldiers, and at least one Fusilier who will sit
second on the drover’s bench.

He has hired a soothsayer to cast the portents before they set out, to predict which of the three
may be attacked. These predictions are sealed in an envelope and delivered to the hand of the
Captain of each detail.

Carolus has sent Captain Morgan Bosevell, his cousin, to oversee this process. Captain Morgan
is also the only one who will know which of the three chests will actually contain the jewels, and
she has obtained use of a fast airship, the Zephyr, to zip back and forth along the courses of all
three coaches. You can refer to the three coaches as Gold, Ebon, and Crimson, after the hair
color of its drover.

Captain Bosevell’s strategy session with the PCs will invite them to participate in the final
planning. Do the players wish to go with Gold, Ebon, or Crimson, or would they rather ride in the
airship with Morgan? What problems do they anticipate occurring, and how will they plan on
countering them? What if their coach is attacked? Allow them to discuss the entire operation, although
if the planning seems to bog down or reach an impasse, have Morgan call the question.

#### The Purpose of Tears of the Sky

This part of the story is not just for the action, but it is also to demonstrate the depth and breadth of the
Shadow Cat’s network. She is not just a power in Lutetia. It’s also to provide them with the clue
that will lead them to chasing the Shadow Cat into the Scarlet Party.

#### How It Plays Out

Here are some suggestions as to how you might navigate through this story from this point.

  - **Predestination:** Before the players strategize, write down on a slip of paper where the
    jewels are, and write down all the portents ahead of time. Stick to this no matter what the
    players decide to do. In this scenario, the Shadow Cat is actually in play, she’ll have hired
    some brigands to help her track the coaches and manipulate others to create delays for them.

  - **Star Power:** Allow the players' planning to inform what’s actually happening. The players
    are told where the jewels are. Give them a chance to protect them from direct action. In
    this method, you can tailor the portents to what the players have decided. Shadow Cat
    and some Cat’s Paws are in play.

  - **The Big Lie:** Decide from the beginning that this whole setup is a charade, a complicated
    trap designed to smoke the Shadow Cat out of hiding and capture her. The portents are
    blank. The players will be well placed to attempt capture. There are no jewels, there
    never were any jewels. Shadow Cat is not an idiot, but she will not be able to resist hiring
    some Cat’s Paws to do her dirty work.

#### Encounter Ideas for “Tears of the Sky”

  - An Ambush by some Cat’s Paws who start with pistols to stop the coach and then wade
    in with swords. A hidden obstacle of some kind along the road would be needed to truly
    stop the transport. The Shadow Cat may attempt to steal the chest during the distraction.

  - Church Guardsmen reporting to Arch-Chaplain Farrazin are encountered along the road. They have no idea what the coach is,
    but they want to stop and inspect it. This could result in a fight, and if that happens it
    might be a good time to have some Cat’s Paws or Shadow Cat take advantage to
    potentially steal the chest.

  - The coach is mired down, or blocked, or broken. This is a good time to have someone
    with Science (Clockworks) with you. It is also a time when Shadow
    Cat or a Cat’s Paw may attempt a theft.

  - A chase. The coach is obviously not at an advantage here. If a Cavalier has to drive the
    coach, she may use Nature (Husbandry) or if not that, an Initiative specialty. 
    Nature (Explore) or Science (Clockworks) is the skill for flying an airship, if indeed they are staying with the Zephyr.
    Remember that Cavaliers do not have to roll for maintaining their balance, leaping, or
    climbing, so in theory a Cavalier could leap from the back of one carriage to the front of
    another.

  - A coach stops for the night at an inn, and a tavern brawl ensues when Cat’s Paws stir up
    trouble for them. Treat the tavern patrons as “Drunken Brawler” Rabble.
    
  - Ferry crossing. A coach is fired upon as it is slowly being ferried across a river. Do the
    Cavaliers return to the other side, or forge ahead? What happens when some Cat’s
    Paws come down the river in punts with muskets, or throwing daggers?

  - Some Cat’s Paws drop down from the tree canopy onto the rushing coach, and there is a
    fight as the carriage careens along a dusty road. Cavaliers can demonstrate their
    prowess brawling on the running board, or performing swordplay as tree branches
    attempt to sweep them off.

#### Wrap­Up of “Tears of the Sky”

Depending on what you decide in “How It Plays Out,” to wrap up this part of the story you will
need to send a strong signal that more information can be discovered at the Scarlet Party, an
event coming up soon. One of the Cat’s Paws will have a wine knife with a scarlet mask painted
on it hidden on his person, or an invitation for a previous party will be found on one of them, or a
red velvet bag with a small flask of wine in it – one of the party favors for a previous Scarlet
Party. Or interrogation yields this information, perhaps that they were supposed to meet the
Shadow Cat at the party.

Captain Bosevell will reward the Cavaliers if they are successful in fighting off the brigands, Cat’s
Paws, Church troops, and other obstacles and if the coaches reach Lutetia relatively unharmed.
The each of players may choose a Minor Favor from Carolus (forgiveness of a minor slight, special
leave from duty, an introduction to a third party), or a monetary reward worth 1D6. If you are
playing “Predestination” or “Star Power,” you can even offer a 1D8 reward, for the Prince­Consort
is truly happy to have his jewels back in hand. If they fail to protect the jewels, however, they may
be put on a punishment duty, like guarding Carolus's pampered puppies.

### The Scarlet Party

Shortly after returning to the barracks (perhaps the next day or the next evening), the Cavaliers
receive an invitation to the Scarlet Party. It is known that the Viscountess is impressed by their
bravery in the affair of the Tears of the Sky, and wishes to reward them with an evening of
pleasure.

The truth is that the Viscountess wishes to convince others of her public persona’s innocence
and is planning on using the Queen’s Cavaliers for just that purpose! A Cat’s Paw has agreed to
smash the case for the Ruby and make her “escape.”

#### Events At The Party

The Scarlet Party is a prime location for you as a MJ to add some complexity to our Cavaliers’
lives. Romances may blossom, slights perceived, intrigues begun, wagers proposed. Most of
these opportunities have to do with characters who are there. The Viscountess does a great deal
of work to make sure interesting persons turn up.

  - **The Comtesse Gurlois Balmains,** who recently had a Lirien Rose stolen and is here to
    complain and receive sympathy.

  - **Rossignol,** a chanteur with a very beautiful voice and **Lord Moineau,** who are meeting
    here for the first time in a romantic way (Moineau has adored Rossignol’s voice for years).

  - **Ariadne Sul,** a charlatan who claims to be a Speaker heretic, but spends much of her
    time “researching” recreational substances. (And happens to be the Shadow Cat’s
    source for her sleep­powder!)

  - **Herbert Georges,** the handsome owner of the first airship shipping company in Lutetia,
    looking for investors, enjoying the Viscountess’ deep wine cellar.

  - **Baroness Marjorie Lemain,** a widow who seems to have a never­ending series of young,
    strong, and athletic companions, and is always looking for more (and has a fondness for
    Cavaliers in particular).

#### Glass Shatters After Midnight

In the midst of the party, there is the sound, upstairs, of breaking glass. Upon investigation, the
Viscountess reports that one of her jewels, the priceless Ondalan Ruby pendant she had on
display upstairs in her study, has been stolen! The jewel was in an expensive glass case and
locked down. It was clear that the thief was a second­story operator, who climbed up a rope
attached to a grapnel. This is where the Viscountess does her best to convince all around her of
her distress and sadness at having lost the jewel, and it is also a place where the Cavaliers may
pick up on the fact that she’s not entirely honest about her feelings.

Investigation around the grounds outside finds that a black silk glove with a cat’s­paw
embroidered on it was draped over a bush near the abandoned rope: a sure sign that the
Shadow Cat had struck again.

The party starts up again in full speed when the Viscountess orders a cask of Albian whiskey be
opened and shared “to assist in the recovery from such a shock.” The whiskey is extremely
intoxicating so it may be that the night gets a little befuddled after that.

#### Debriefing

Captain Morgan wants to speak with the Cavaliers the next day (even if they have a hangover)
and question them about what happened at the Scarlet Party. The Crown is considering forming
a special investigations team to hunt down the Shadow Cat, and it’s very possible the players
may be chosen for it.

## Storyline: The Veiled Lady

The theme for this story is “Church versus State.” In this case it is Guardian of the Faith Farrazin
working behind the scenes to thwart to will of the Crown in the guise of her Cavaliers. But, we
also come to understand that there is strife within the church, and difficulty interacting with those
of other religions.

### Overview: The Story So Far

The Cavaliers are rivals with the Church Guardsmen, this is known; but it’s possible that Cavaliers
do not quite know the origin of this rivalry. The Church in Lutetia is run by Farrazin, the Guardian
of the Faith. Farrazin is an ambitious, highly political chaplain. Born in Lutetia but educated in
Cordera, Farrazin privately believes that Gallinea would be a much better country were it to
become like the Matriarchy of Ondala, which is ruled by a Queen whose powers are limited by
the Asrian Church.

Ever since the end of the last war with Ondala the Church of Asria has maintained a private military
force. These Church Guardsmen are trained, outfitted, and disciplined by the Church, and are
answerable only to Church Law and Church Hierarchy. Although Farrazin has been very vocal
about supporting the monarchy, the fact remains that he is in charge of a small to medium­sized
army that is quartered in the capital city; one that is not under the control of Queen Mariana II.

The Queen’s Cavaliers occupy a very specific niche in the power structure of Gallinea and
especially of Lutetia: they are the Queen’s own agents, and they are there to further her goals.
Since Farrazin and his Church Guardsmen are frequently opposed to these goals, Cavaliers find
themselves engaging in thoughtful debates with them. These discussions usually take place at a
comfortable distance, usually as long as a rapier’s length, and are energetic and somewhat
dangerous.

Of course the Queen cannot afford to offend the Church of Asria, as it is extremely popular in
Gallinea. It is the religion of her birth and of her mother, so she walks a fine line between outright
antagonism and genteel hypocrisy. On the other hand, Farrazin knows that if the Matriarch of the
Church, Isabene de la Justicia, got word that he was actively opposing a duly consecrated Asrian­Faithful
Queen, she might just have his guts for garters. The peace after the war with Ondala was hard­won and
largely based on this shared religious heritage.

With all the scheming that Farrazin is doing, however, he has not been extremely good about policing his
own ranks. When he first came in to power, he sent a lot of older chaplains packing and installed his own
creatures; younger Chaplains who owed him loyalty, or those with whom he held leverage. Not a terribly
trusting soul, is Farrazin, and he has even gone so far as to hire agents of his own in secret, including
duelists such as the Lady in Red, Martine Deveaux, an ex­Cavalier.

As a result of Farrazin’s lack of focus on his own house, a secret heretical sect has begun meeting in the
very walls of the Grand Cathedral. This sect reveres the Queen as the avatar of Asria herself. This goes back
to the origins of Asria, as it was said she was an Empress in Old Qarta. The Queen was consecrated on her
coronation by the holy oil of Asitra, an early Prophetess of Asria and the Asitran heretics hold the belief that
the Queen is the manifestation of the Goddess in the world. This has been backed up by secret, sacred
writings and prophetic visionary dreams.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
This heresy is secret, of course, but it is run by the Maiden Chaplain Kilara, a bright, charismatic woman
who came to Asrianism though her family was Devran. As Maiden Chaplain she is the junior most of three
Chaplains under Farrazin. Kilara met Her Majesty the Queen at a Harvest ritual gathering, and the two
became fast friends. Queen Mariana II then made a formal request that Kilara become her household
Chaplain, to minister to her family specifically, a request that could not be denied without a serious problem.
At first Farrazin attempted to cajole Kilara into reporting on the goings on in the Royal Household, but when
she steadfastly refused him, Farrazin suborned the Maiden Chaplain’s personal guards, two Church
Guardsmen newly promoted for the purpose.

The reports from these spies have made Farrazin somewhat suspicious of the closeness that
Kilara has with the Queen. Her star is on the rise, and Kilara has managed to convince the
Queen to become a more observant Asrian than she has been in the past.

That brings us to the present time, and the start of things.

Farrazin has made sure that Chaplain Kilara will be dealt a black eye and lose favor in the sight
of the Queen by hiring saboteurs to ruin the ritual she is running. In order to do this, he has hired
Martine Deveaux, an ex­Cavalier, to recruit the saboteurs. Thus, this story could introduce
Martine to the players as a future antagonist.

Five days ago, Martine hired some vagabonds to sabotage the dancing platform, and provided
them with a mechanician who has a stolen airship, who trained one of the vagabonds to fly it
reasonably well.

### Part One: The Dance Among the Clouds

It is the late Spring. Our brave Cavaliers have been tapped to attend to a most exclusive party:
the Dance Among the Clouds, in honor of the day many years ago when the Queen became a
woman and was confirmed in the faith of the Goddess. Artisans have spent the last four months
preparing the spectacle of the actual dance platform, which is a large wooden decking designed
to float atop 14 separate balloon envelopes, all lashed together. The Queen’s Own Chaplain,
Kilara, has agreed to perform the ceremony of blessing for the Queen, and it is hoped that this
ceremony will ensure her fertiity and good health for the year to come.

The Party actually begins on the ground to the north of Lutetia. As the late Spring dawn rises, the
envelopes begin to inflate and the dancing platform lifts gently off the ground, flying with the wind
majestically, slowly, as the cool wind from the North nudges the cloud platform along South,
toward the city. Many musicians play, providing music for pavannes, allemandes, galliards, and
sarabandas. Several structures in Lutetia have been set to prepare for the procession of the
dance platform, and will catch it and anchor it tight, allowing it to fly higher over the city and
closer to the sun.

When the sun is directly overhead, the ritual will begin. In addition to her own blessing, the
Queen has found other girls who have had their first flowering and who would like to be
confirmed in the faith of the Goddess. Kilara will conduct these rituals as well. Finally, at the end
of the ritual, everyone will be invited to come forward and receive a token of omen from the
Chaplain, to give them guidance in the year to come. These omen tokens are kept in a special
sacred box, and anyone may draw one forth from within.

The dancing platform is the brainchild of Madame Felina Porvore, Mistress of the Royal
Mechanists and foremost ballooneer in Gallinea. She and her crew of highly trained ballooneers
will be in charge of flying the platform and ensuring that it remains aloft for the duration of the
party.

The Cavaliers must keep safe the Queen and her honored guests, but it is not required that they
stand like dour sentries: they may circulate amongst the crowd and mingle, using their wit,
charm, and intellect to guard the royal person. Baronetta Giavanna Morel is the chief Cavalier in
charge of security for the day; she will be watching with eagle eyes for potential sabotage and
continuously inspecting the work of the mechanists.

Church Guardsmen will be on the platform as well. Baronetta Giavanna has let her Cavaliers know
that any brawling will be punished most severely unless it can be proved that it was not begun by
them. She does not wish her Cavaliers to fail to defend themselves or their charges, but she
doesn’t want any violence to mar the day for the Queen.

The day progresses fairly well at first, the ritual goes off without any trouble. It goes so well, in
fact, that the Cavaliers are given the option to go to the altar and receive an Omen Token if they
wish. It’s not until the last people filter past to receive their benison from the Chaplain that trouble
truly starts.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: sidebar ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:# The Omen Token

The Omen Token is part of the ceremony that celebrates the first flowering of a woman. It is
supposed to give the person who receives it an idea of what to expect from their life to come.
Here are the thirteen Omen Tokens and what they mean.

  - **The Sign of Youth:** You will always have a youthful aspect, and young people will be important to you.
  - **The Sign of Strength:** You will be strong of mind and heart, and must avoid the curse of obstinacy.
  - **The Sign of Travel:** You will travel far, if only inside your own mind.
  - **The Sign of Motherhood:** You will be a caregiver and a nurturer, as you, yourself have been nurtured.
  - **The Sign of Beauty:** Your beauty will be both without and within.
  - **The Sign of Purity:** You will overcome efforts to taint your spirit, and you will purify others.
  - **The Sign of Justice:** You will receive justice, but also be judged by it.
  - **The Sign of Forgiveness:** You will be forgiven of your wrongdoings, but must also learn to forgive.
  - **The Sign of Self­Knowledge:** You will receive the gift of knowing the truth of who you really are.
  - **The Sign of Prosperity:** Through hard work you will gain fortune.
  - **The Sign of Friendship:** Your friendship will be both burden and blessing.
  - **The Sign of Renewal:** You will make yourself anew, again and again.
  - **The Sign of the All:** Your fate is unwritten: only the Goddess knows it.

As a suggestion, allow players to choose which Token they receive. At some point during play,
let them invoke that Sign to influence the course of the story or gain a Bonus Die +1D8 on any roll.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Things Fly Apart

Several of the balloons holding up the platform begin to slowly separate. The Cavaliers will be
among the first to notice this, as they are paying close attention to the platform and the
happenings around it.

#### Acts of Derring­Do

There are plenty of opportunities for the Cavaliers to help stranded guests, save people, assist
the Queen or her family, and help them all get to safety. There are no rolls for this! The Cavaliers
are professional swashbucklers, they could make magnificent leaps and bounds all day if they
needed to, and look good whilst doing it. Ask them who they’re rescuing and in what order.

Dame Porvore will beg Baronetta Giavanna to assist her with chasing down “a pack of
sable­clad saboteurs” sighted in the under­rigging of the dance platform. Porvore has a
mechanism which begins to slowly lower the platform to the ground, but the emphasis on this is
*slow*. The saboteurs must surely still be on the platform as they could not have jumped from
such a great height!

Before they run after the saboteurs, Giavanna warns them that these evil­doers should be
rendered unto the Crown still alive, so that their secrets may be taken from them.

#### The Chase in the Sky

Finding the saboteurs is not difficult. Even though there are spindly catwalks, rope ladders and
rigging, the Cavaliers traverse these as easily as crossing the street.

Use the “Dangerous Revolutionary” Stock Character for these saboteurs. The number of
opponents is equal to the number of player Cavaliers plus one. One of them (the airship pilot
among them) is trying to lasso a small airship that has slipped its moorings to make their
getaway while the others fight off the Cavaliers.

As the MJ, perform an Aim check versus Moderate difficulty (3d8) for this rope­thrower each
round of combat until the Cavaliers reach her, or she makes it. It will then take a round or two
before the saboteur can pull the airship close enough for her co­conspirators to hop aboard. If
the Aim check is failed three rounds in a row, then the airship is unrecoverable as it floats off on
the afternoon breeze. Three rounds after this unrecoverable failure, the small airship floats too
far away for even a Cavalier to swing out on some rope and secure it.

The saboteurs are afraid of being delivered into the hands of the government, so they will fight
fiercely to stay free. Their Loyalty and Pride are such that they would not willingly hand
themselves over to agents of the Queen.

#### If the Saboteurs Begin to Escape

Remember that, even if the saboteurs manage to board the airship and begin to fly off, the
Cavaliers can still reach the airship by swinging out on ropes and catching on to the railing or
otherwise climbing aboard. The ship, while under way, is only near enough to the dance platform
undercarriage to allow two Cavaliers to do this.

If these two Cavaliers manage to defeat the remaining saboteurs on the airship, they will soon
discover that the airship, overloaded with weight from so many extra crew, is slowly headed for
the ground. This slow crash will be lessened if a Cavalier will leap off once they reach the
rooftops of Lutetia and secure the airship using one of its dangling moorings.

#### If the Saboteurs Do Escape

There is a chance that the saboteurs may defeat the Cavaliers. The airship pilot saboteur will adjust the
envelope on the airship for the extra weight, and fly off to the South. They will not kill the
Cavaliers, but will bind them and leave them unconscious. They will come awake later, at night,
in the gondola of the deflated airship, to the south of Lutetia not far from the Riverbreeze Baths (a
helpful road sign announces). When they awaken they will untie themselves and begin the long
walk back to the city, no doubt stopping in a few traveler’s inns on the way for a cup of wine and
a bit of dinner. A suggestion: do not delay them getting back into the city. Perhaps they meet
other Cavaliers returning from a patrol, or can get a ride from a kindly merchant.

### Aftermath if the Saboteurs Do Not Escape

Once captured and subdued, the saboteurs will be delivered to La Roche Prison and turned over
to Prince Jean­Remy’s Whisperers for interrogation, with thanks given by Baronetta Giavanna.
No reward is offered, but Giavanna hints that the Queen is pleased with them.

###  Part Two: A Ride in the Country

Prince Jean­Remy will have his lieutenant, Baron Vichy, summon the Cavaliers for an interview
at the palace. They will discuss the facts of the intervention with the saboteurs and, if the
saboteurs were apprehended, the facts gained through questioning them.

Baron Vichy explains that the prisoners were branded with thief­marks and were illegal returnees
from Elissia. They were recruited by a mysterious figure wearing a Devran robe and sand­hood who had no
discernable gender. They were to be paid 8 Crowns apiece, with 1 Crown earnest money already being
given. This meeting took place on the road near Sand­town, a village to the South of the city, and they were
transported to the North of the city, where a rogue mechanician provided them with transportation to the
platform. This mechanician is being hunted down by another group of Cavaliers.

Vichy gives them orders written out and counter­signed by Baronetta Giavanna. They are to ride to
Sand­town and attempt to discover who may have hired these traitors.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: sidebar ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:# Transportation

Whenever the Cavaliers need it, they may visit the stables of the Queen’s Barracks, where they sign out a
mount with all the needed tack. The Mistress of the Queen’s Stables is Lady Pruneau, and she takes a very
dim view of Cavaliers who mistreat or do not return their mounts. Of course, some Cavaliers are wealthy
enough to afford their own horses, and do not have to suffer the watchful eye of Lady Pruneau. A missing
mount will be charged to the Cavalier, who must pay 1D8 to replace it.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Sand­Town

Located on the banks of the Luisante River to the south of Lutetia, Sand­town was once a thriving
glass­blowing artisanal community, but it has since become a haven community for Devranism.

Glass­blowing artisans still work here, and they still collect the silt from the river to dry it and use it to create
glass. The Devran faithful who live here keep to themselves and do not treat well with outsiders, they have
Factors in the city who buy and sell their glassware.

Needless to say, it is likely that the Cavaliers are not welcome here. Here is a list of information which you
may either give out or have them obtain through uses of Interaction and Streetwise.

   - There is no tavern, nor is there an inn for travelers here. The nearest such is a place called the Riverbreeze Baths.
   - The holy robes of a Speaker for the Desert Mother are not for sale to anyone.
   - The robes of a Speaker are ritually beaten and cleansed every three days. During this time the Speaker wears sacred undergarments and stays behind closed doors.
   - A set of robes went missing from the line five days ago, and have not been located.
   - The Riverbreeze Baths are a hedonistic place of loose morals that should be shut down immediately!

The Devran believers accept all people who come with an open heart and a willingness to open their
minds to the worship of the Desert Mother. They occasionally give safe harbor to refugees and
vagabonds who profess an interest in the faith and they do not ask questions of these wayward
souls as to the nature of their distress. The Devrans will not reveal which of their number is in this
status, though it may be obvious to a Perceive or Deduce roll.

Interrogating other vagabonds may give this information:

   - The saboteurs were all friends. They bragged about the money they were going to make. The plan
     was to purchase a flophouse in the city and get work there, although she knew that they would
     most likely waste the money on cards and wine. One of the saboteurs noticed that the priestess
     who hired them smelled very strongly of sandalwood oil, which is an expensive perfume. (This is a
     clue that points right to the Riverbreeze Baths.)

#### The Ambush

The Cavaliers’ investigation of Sand­town plays into the hands of Farrazin, who wants to cover his tracks. As
a result he has sent a small group of Church Guardsmen to follow them when they leave the city, and
ambush them when the time seems right. The fact that they’ve just come from the Devran community gives
them a chance to accuse them of suspicious dealings taking place among the Devrans.

There are two more Guardsmen than there are Cavaliers. Use the Rogue Highwayman Minor Character stat
block for the leader of the Guardsmen and use Grizzled Veterans for the others. The ambush will start with
pistol fire and proceed immediately to swordplay and brawling.

The purpose of this ambush is to just inflict pain on the Cavaliers whilst Martine has a chance to make her
escape. A rider has gone ahead to warn her of the Cavaliers’ appearance at Sand­Town. Farrazin has
provided this protection to his agent.

If the Cavaliers are defeated their valuables are taken as “penance” and a “donation to the Church” and left
beside the road. Their mounts can be found with a little judicious searching in the nearby woods.

If the Cavaliers defeat the Church Guardsmen they will find a Riverbreeze Baths token in the pocket of the leader.

The Cavaliers could, at this point, return to the city to report what happened and the information they found,
and that would satisfy Vichy well enough, although the Baths token might be particularly compelling.

#### The Riverbreeze Baths

::::::::::::::::::: pic-outside :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Martine Deveaux, by Joanne Renaud](assets/Scenes/Medium/martine-dress.jpg)
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
If the Cavaliers discover the Riverbreeze Baths prior to the Ambush, they will find the Baths open for
business. A number of well­to­do and hedonistic nobles regularly take a river barge down to the Baths for a
delightful Old Qartan­style bath experience: water heated in large cisterns and poured into large baths that
can accommodate many people at once. Massage sessions and delicious food served on a veranda which
is cooled by river breezes also attract a wealthy following.

Opulent bedrooms are provided for those guests who are wishing privacy or who would like to sleep the night
away and renew themselves yet again in the morning. They may even meet the Viscountess Magdalene
LaBeau, who adores this place. They will certainly meet Martine Deveaux in one of her many disguises, who
uses this place as a safehouse (one of many). The staff at the Riverbreeze will request they pay d8 to
receive services there, or leave. If one of them Prowls around, they may find Martine’s room while she is
away enjoying a massage.

The Ambush will happen right after they arrive, however, and Martine will also leave quietly and quickly.
f they discover it after the Ambush, the Riverbreeze will be empty and abandoned. Searching through the
place they will find Martine’s room, which has a number of interesting items in amongst the normal living
accoutrements of a noble lady:

  - A red fox cloissone pin. This is a clue to Martine’s identity, for her sigil is the red fox.
  - A complete and authentic Devran Speaker robe and sand­hood.
  - A fine sword with a ruby pommel worth d8 which is clearly a wooing­gift from a prospective lover.
  - A gold medallion with the Holy Seal of the Grand Cathedral stamped into it. This was meant as a
       bona­fide for Martine should she ever be apprehended by Church Guardsmen or Chaplains, although
       it is also valuable and could be misconstrued as a mere treasure. As treasure, it's worth a 1D6 Reward.
  - A small box in which is a vial of Sandalwood oil worth a 1D6 Reward.

#### Debriefing

Baron Vichy will not give much feedback to the Cavaliers once they return and report what they learned, he
will thank them for their report. He will confiscate the medallion if it is revealed, but allow the Cavaliers to
keep the other items they found. This information just confirms what Prince Jean­Remy already knows about
Martine Deveaux and adds to his mounting case of information against Farrazin.

The saboteurs are to be forcibly re­patriated to Elissia, with the promise that they will be killed if they return
to Gallinea. The rogue mechanician who supplied the small airship was not found. The airship was collected
by the Queen’s Air Navy and will be rehabilitated for its use.

Afterward, any valuables the Cavaliers may have lost will be replaced (if possible) mysteriously through
packages left for them. In each package is a card that says, “With love, from a Sister.” It is Kilara trying to
make up for the excesses of Farrazin. This particular clue may one day be used to further reveal the Astrian Heresy.

There is no doubt that Martine Deveaux will have learned the Cavalier’s names and will be constantly on the
lookout for them. She may decide in the future to even the score with them and take the initiative to do so:
this is definitely not the last time the Cavaliers will hear from the Lady in Red.
