:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Hermic (pictured on the left) is always the brains of any operation. She runs a gang of mostly 
female bandits (Tanglestern is the only male one). In true Robin Hood style, they rob from the 
rich and give to the less fortunate…minus operating costs of course. She fights best with her crossbow.

Tanglestern (on the right) is the mouthpiece and general distraction for the group’s work. He 
is brazen and smarmy, and thinks himself oh-so-handsome and dashing. He fights best with his 
sword and words… so very, very many words.
