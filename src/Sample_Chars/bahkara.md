Few details are known about Bahkara. He has just recently become noticed by the authorities of 
both Ondala and Gallinea. He can found speaking to the people, denouncing the current governments 
and attempting to get the people to join his "Cavaliers de Sol" in an effort to overthrow the 
governments. When he speaks his face is always covered by a bandanna and he is always seen wearing 
a sleeveless hooded cloak with a large sun symbol on the back. In addition, Bahkara also has a 
large sun tattooed on his right shoulder.

Bahkara is most likely from Ondala. He has an Ondalan accent when speaking and on the occasions 
where Bahkara has had to defend himself, which is often, it has been noted that he has an Ondalan 
fighting style. What is also known is the reason for his actions. Bahkara admits to being in the 
military at one time and fighting in many the the wars and skirmishes in the past. It is the death 
of his comrades, due the whims of the privileged nobility, that has fueled his desire for justice 
and to seek an end to the current "corrupt" govenments.

Thanks to the current prosperous years, most people do not pay much heed to him, but these years of 
prosperity will not last and Bahkara is preparing for that day when the masses will rise up to 
deliver the justice that he believes the nobility deserve.

What is not known is Bahkara's other life, as dueling instructor "Gauriel Persolei." When not speaking 
against the tyranny of the govenment he is actually instructing those he rails against in the art of 
the duel. This allows him access to many areas of the land not accessible to the average citizen and 
allows him to gauge any future enemies up close. No one even knows his real name. What has also 
happened is his growing affection for one of his pupils, Ashlain, a noblewoman from Gallinea. 
It is unsure whether this budding love will help or hinder Bahkara's cause.

Behind the scenes Bahkara is very friendly, gregarious, thoughtful and kind to the people and 
especially those in the organization. He is loyal to his friend, Gerard, who also survived the wars 
and co-founded the organization. He values the friends he has made while fighting for the cause and 
to those he considers his inner circle.

When speaking to the masses Bahkara's demeanor changes to a very somber voice when he recalls what 
happened to him and he begins talking about the corrupt government systems and the need for change. 
When fighting duels or against government officials, Bahkara tends to smile and laugh the whole time 
and exudes confidence, dancing around his opponents, all the while trading physical and verbal barbs.
