:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Coming from a long line of Gallinean knights and soldiers, Jean-Paul has always felt that patriotism is in his blood. 
His particular talents have always run toward both sharpshooting and horsemanship, so he was quickly 
assigned to a horse artillery unit upon enlisting in the Queen’s Army. As his grandmother was a famous 
general, he was quickly promoted to an officer position.

As a strict by-the-books capitaine in the Armée du Nord, Jean-Paul isn’t an inspiring leader but is a reliable 
one; his superiors know that he will always obey orders to the best of his ability.

Proud as Jean-Paul is of his family history, he’s even more proud of Gallinea, which he considers to be the 
greatest country in all of Elara – and beyond.
