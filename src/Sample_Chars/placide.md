:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Placide was orphaned in Ekalia as a young child. By 10, iel had been taken aboard a
Gallinean vessel as a cabin-keeper. Iel spent the last 16 years either at sea or 
in a port town learning the craft of alchemy from ier mentor, La Dona Montoya. Iel
has come a long way since then, and is now a ship's doctor. Placide has garnered
quite a reputation for keeping a crew safe during a see journey and is thus in
great demand when free, giving iem a free choice as to which assignments to take.

Placide is an agender individual who doesn't consider ielself to be either
male or female. Iem uses the *iel / iem / ier / ielself* pronouns instead of
*she* or *he*. For more on agender characters in world of *The Queen's Cavaliers*,
