Valero de Diega is a bold and daunting Ondalan, with big shoulders and a great smile, who seduces the 
ladies with his tanned skin and robust build. He has a full oblong face and likes to wear a 
well-trimmed beard and mustache. Valero keeps his wavy auburn hair short, because it kept 
strangling on the mechanical tools of his invention. He usually wears his swashbuckling outfit 
form-fitting with his rapier gearsword, "La Inquieta", at his left side, one dagger at the 
right and a second dagger in his left boot.

Born in a hard working family, his mother spent the family's money on Valero's education. 
That was a double-edged sword; in one hand Valero grew as a fabulous clockwork mechanician 
under the tutelage of Alonso Mesarede, one of the most brilliant Ondalan clockworks mechanicians, 
though underrated and misunderstood. On the other hand, his extended family took a vow on destroying 
him and his works because they wanted the money for themselves.

As a direct cause of this intention, Valero has developed a strange but effective dueling 
technique; he mixed the classic Ondalan dexterity with his own knowledge of gearsword maneuvers. 
This strange mismatch of styles made his reputation as a cunning opponent.

Valero has a strong sense of justice developed by the assassination of his mother at the hands of 
his family, a matter he never could prove; as an Asrian devotee he took inspiration on the works 
and deeds of Matriarch Isabine and based his own honor on her figure. That made his reputation 
as an honorable and loyal companion. Under the service of Queen Mariana II he meet his peers and 
his true love, Florinda Leren, a young and noble mistress of black hair, sheep-like gaze and grey eyes.
