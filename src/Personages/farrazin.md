::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Arch-Chaplain Farrazin, Guardian of the Faith of Gallinea, is proof that a man
can ascend from lowly beginnings to the highest positions, if that man has the
ambition to see it through. One of Lutetia's foundlings, Farrazin was raised
by the Church in their orphanages and abbeys. Even from a young age he showed
a keen intellect as well as a willingness to push aside others to get what he
wanted.

Determined to better himself, Farrazin requested an early appointment to study
as a Chaplain in Cordera, Ondala. Young Farrazin made quite an impression at the
seminary due to his sharp tongue, brilliant rhetoric, and fierce loyalty to
Gallinea. When he graduated and was appointed to a small chapel in Scanbria, the
theologians of Cordera were more than happy to see him gone.

Starting in Affutaine, chaplain Farrazin worked his way up the hierarchy of Gallinea's
Asrian church, finally ascending to arch-chaplain of Lutetia and Guardian of the Faith
upon the death of his predecessor. In public he presents an air of polite concern and
caring for all he meets, while in private he is more than willing to use duplicitous
means to get what he wants.

What he wants is twofold: He wants to increase the power of Gallinea throughout the
world, and he wants to increase his personal authority. During Queen Elisse's reign,
he "kindly volunteered" to be her interim Minister of Justice, a position he continues
to hold under Queen Marianna. He is a major proponent of expansionist foreign
policy, and doesn't fear provoking a war with any of Gallinea's neighbors.

Guardian Farrazin has a small army of church soldiers, meant to be ceremonial temple
guards but highly militarized under his watch; most are retired soldiers or mercenaries.
These Holy Guardsmen are often in direct conflict with the Queen's Cavaliers, 
a jealous rivalry that sometimes flares into outright dueling. In addition to the
Holy Guardsmen, Farrazin has close ties to Martine Deveaux, notorious ex-Cavalier,
although those ties are not common knowledge.

Farrazin isn't all bad, though. He likes cats, sometimes petting them as he sits at
his desk in the Grand Cathedral of the Sun, speaking to those to whom he grants an
audience.

:::::::::::::::: enemy ::::::::::::::::::::::::::
With a network of spies that rivals that of Prince Jean-Remy,
his own personal army in the form of the Holy Guardsmen, and
direct access to the cavalier-turned-assassin Martine Deveaux,
Farrazin can be deadly enemy. His own combat abilities are limited
so he works better as a master planner, working behind the scenes
to discredit and destroy the Cavaliers.

:::::::::::::::::: ally :::::::::::::::::::::::::
While he may have his own agenda, Farrazin is still a patriotic Gallinean
and doesn't wish to see harm come to Mariana. He would oppose
any attempt to harm the country or its queen, and would gladly
work with Cavaliers on matters of national defense or national
pride. He may also provide the Cavaliers with information that
they can't get through other means.
