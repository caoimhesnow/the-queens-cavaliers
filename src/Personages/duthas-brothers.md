# Duthas {.cbreakbefore}

Mother Duthas was cursed. That's the only conclusion, she felt. Time after time she
bore sons; sons, who could never hope to become anything great, just manual
laborers. Many of her neighbors in the Lowlands considered it a blessing 
when she finally was unable to have further children.

Unwanted as they are, each from a different father they never knew, the 
brothers Duthas grew up together with no one trust save themselves. This
bitterness led them to lash out, becoming a gang of cruel bullies as children.
This continued into adulthood, taking up careers in banditry and extortion,
all under the thumb of Mother Duthas.

The brothers proudly boast that no Duthas has ever served in the Queen's
Army, with all of them having refused an order of enlistment during the
Twenty Years' War. While their countrymen were dying, they were smuggling
weapons and contraband in Dunon, Albingia, and even Elissia.

On a smuggling run to Nouville, the Duthas brothers met Martine Deveaux,
a notorious spy who had been expelled from the Queen's Cavaliers some
years before. Martine did a great favor the Brothers that they could not
do themselves; Mother Duthas died peacefully in her sleep. From that time,
the brothers Duthas were free from one master but had taken on a new one.
Martine has proven herself to be less abusive and demanding of the brothers.

Each Duthas brother is a large mountain of a man, with a shrewd cunning in
matters of bandritry that is belied by their brutish appearance and Lowlander
demeanor. Many have underestimated one of the brothers Duthas, and few have
survived to regret it.

The Brothers Duthas are usually, but not always, found
working for the renegade member of the Queen's Cavaliers, Martine
Deveaux. Usually only one will be involved with any given scheme at
a time. There are several of them -- however many you need as MJ --
in case you have bloodthirsty players who kill them off. The Brothers
can also be used to represent any none-too-bright but all-too-strong
henchmen or members of the brute squad.

Whichever Duthas this might be, it turns out he's not as
bad as the others. Maybe he had one of his brothers die in an
earlier fight with the player characters and he fears the same fate, 
or maybe he's shocked by Martine's current plan. This single Duthas, then, might help
the players by revealing that scheme and helping them put a stop to it.
