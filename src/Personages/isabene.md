The life of Isabene de la Justicia, Matriarch of the Asrian Church, has certain parallels with those
of Arch-Chaplain Farrazin. Both rose from lowly beginnings to a place of prominence in the Church.
However, when it comes to personality, the two clerics couldn't be more different.

Isabene was born to Ondalan subsistence farmers in the Fuenta province, near Diega. When a neighbor's
child was gored by a rampaging bull, her herbal medicines and prayers to Ashra were credited with saving the
boy's life. Held up as an exemplar of the faith and gifted by the Sun, she was annointed as a priestess 
before she turned 17. Her compassion for the poor endeared her to the people of Fuenta, but won her no
friends in nearby Diega.

In several passionate sermons to growing crowds at the Fuentan Temple of the Sun, Isabene laid out the
case against the debauched hedonism of Diegan culture and the inherent injustice of the Ondalan social
hierarchy. These sermons, and her writings on the same theme, earned her the sobriquet of "de la Justicia."

When her name was pushed forward as the new Guardian of the Faith of the Fuenta province, the theologians
in Cordera protested her lack of formal education, unwilling to overlook it as the Fuentan clergy had done.
This led to Isabene taking several years off from her ministry to the poor of Fuenta. Her
writings continued with the same fiery passion as before, but now expressed in the formalized language
and strict theological underpinnings demanded by the seminarians.

When the Guardians of the Faith gathered to determine Ashra's will for the next Bride of the Sun 12 years
ago, no one was as surprised as Isabene when she was selected. She almost turned it down, but then her 
old village chaplain convinced her that Ashra had chosen her for a reason and she should accept the position.

Isabene's tenure has been marked by an increased focus on helping the poor and disenfranchised; the Matriarch
and late Queen Elisse had mutual respect for each other, to the chagrin of Arch-Chaplain Farrazin. Isabene is
humble while Farrazin is ostentatious; she is apolitical while he is blatantly nationalistic; she is a voice for
justice with compassion, while he is a notorious legalist.

The Matriarch is best kept mostly out of the picture, as she
doesn't care to meddle too much in the affairs of her own church.
However, if the players manage to befriend her, she can use her
authority to have them released from church imprisonment, or pardon
crimes against the church. In return, she would ask the player
characters to help the impoverished people of Elara and Ifran.

The Church itself makes for a good opponent for Cavaliers, as they
have a variety of ways to challenge player characters, from the rivalry
between the Queen's Cavaliers and the Holy Guardsmen, to the clandestine
schemes of Farrazin and Martine. And the Matriarch *is* the Church, for
all intents and purposes. She could be an easily manipulated fool whose
arch-chaplains are manipulating her, or she could be a dastardly schemer
at the middle of a web of intrigue from her palatial Holy See in Cordera.
