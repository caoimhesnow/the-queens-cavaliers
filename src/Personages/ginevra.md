::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Comodora Ginevra de Hiedra y Obispo is the fleet captain of the New Corderan Colonial Fleet. She is the youngest 
fleet captain in the Holy Navy of Ondala and is a loyal supporter of Queen Ximena. Some say her loyalty is more ... personal
than mere patriotism, intimating that the naval officer's meteoric rise through the ranks was the result of sexual
liaisons between her and the Ondalan Queen.

Her current assignment has her as the primary military commander of the Ondalan forces in Nueva Cordera, with an
authority that threatens the colonial governor. Ginevra has the absolute power to shut down any colony port in 
West Ifran, both in New Cordera and in neighboring Elissia and New Dunon.

Ginevra's primary charge is to protect Ondalan trade from piracy and smugglers, although she operates with a
loose definition of piracy that changes to justify nearly any order she issues. While some may question her
methods, none can doubt her results, as pirate attacks on Ondalan ships have drastically decreased since the
arrival of the Colonial Fleet, with a corresponding increase in New Dunon and Elissia.

Despite her prideful ambition, Ginevra is a reliable military commander with a solid grasp of naval tactics
and a strong loyalty toward those who serve under her. That is, as long as they don't betray her.

Gallinea and Ondala aren't at war. At least, not right now.
That doesn't stop the Comodora from demanding that ships passing
through the Ondalan Channel or near New Cordera submit for
inspection or be fired upon. She could be either a dangerous enemy
out to capture or kill the player characters, or a prideful representative
of a rival country who wants humiliate the players for some perceived or
actual sleight.

Even if the player characters aren't Ondalan, Ginevra might
be willing to work with them. Smugglers and pirates are common
threats to the colonies of both Elissia and New Cordera, and the
comodora might suggest a joint mission undertaken by the Queen's
Cavaliers and some of her Ondalan marines.
