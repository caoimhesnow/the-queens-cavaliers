# Jennevive d'Angelet {.cbreakbefore}

The Duchess of Scanbreille, Jennevive d'Angelet, has traceable descent from the line of Scanbrin queens going
back to just after the fall of Qarta, and claims unverifiable ancestry of pre-Qartan kings from long ago.
She certainly looks the part of a Scanbrian battle-maiden of old; thick red hair, ruddy Varendish features, broad shoulders,
and an air of confident authority. On the wall behind her throne hangs a massive sword of Varendish make, within
arm's reach of the Duchess.

While Jennevive may dress like an 8th century warlady, she is no mere northern barbarian. Scanbreille is well-known for
its embrace of magicks and is a center of charmweaving; Duchess d'Angelet is herself a skilled charmweaver. This seems
to serve her well in politics also, as she has woven the provinces of Scanbria into a tight tapestry that owes more 
loyalty to her personally than to the Pegasus Throne in Lutetia. The Duchess was an outspoken opponent of the Elissian
Reforms, and continues to oppose Elisse's daughter Queen Mariana as the head of the Traditionalist faction in the
Parliament of Nobles.

Duchess d'Angelet is beloved in the north of Gallinea and in Varendia, the country of her husband, Lord Gerhardt von
Schnabelburg, but is mistrusted by many in the south, especially in Lutetia. Many Gallineans, both northerners and
southerners, feel it's only a matter of time before the Scanbreille duchess begins to openly defy the Queen.

Scanbria is not known for its loyalty to the Crown. As the
most notable member of the Traditionalists, Duchess d'Angelet's 
words just barely fall short of outright disrespect of the Queen.
Considered by many in Lutetia to be more Varendish than Gallinean,
she can be used as the planner behind a variety of schemes that undermine respect for
the Queen without veering into outright rebellion. Players who
try to march into her fortress outside of Scanbria may be met with
an unpleasant surprise, as she is quite skilled with her Varendish
greatsword.

If the player characters end up on the outs with the Queen and
the other Gallinean authorities, Scanbria could provide refuge
and sanctuary. D'Angelet is more than willing to work with any
player characters who seek a return to more traditional values
in Gallinean society. After all, who doesn't want to make
Gallinea great again?
