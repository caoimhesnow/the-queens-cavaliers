# Lusienne Castenia {.cbreakbefore}

The current Lady-Mayor of Lutetia is Lusienne, Contessa of Castenia, a province directly adjacent to
Lutetia. Her younger brother, Lord Landiere, is currently the castellan of Castenia and manages the
family fortunes while his sister is away in the captial.

Lusienne Castenia is a flamboyant figure in the court, to say the least; she is well-known for throwing
the grandest parties in Lutetia and of wearing the most outrageous *haute couture*. She is also known
for backroom deals in Parliament and complicated schemes in the streets, with the ultimate goal of 
aiding the crown; Lusienne has been a strong supporter of Queen Mariana. Many suspect that her
over-the-top public persona is a cover for her even bolder political moves.

The Lady-Mayor's patronage of the arts is well-documented, and she regularly opens Palais de Lutetia
for plays and receptions. The people of Lutetia find her to be amusingly entertaining, an enjoyable
alternative to the usually stuffy Royal Family.

::::::::::::::::: ally ::::::::::::::::::::
Lusienne makes for a good ally for Lutetia-based adventures.
She's accessible enough to be able to meet with the players,
unlike most of the royals, but is involved in enough events 
to provide adventure hooks and assistance as needed. If you
need to give your Cavaliers something do, simply have the Lady-Mayor
invite them to one of her many parties! She also makes a good
matron for charmweavers or other artistic characters.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::: enemy ::::::::::::::::::::
Lusienne Castenia can be jealous and spiteful. Any Cavalier who
insults her might themselves not just banned from the next big
party, but also generally shunned by the people of Lutetia. As
loud and as obnoxious as she might be, the Lutetians still love
their big, flamboyant Lady-Mayor, and would believe her over nearly
anyone save the Queen. While Castenia won't try to have anyone
killed, she can still make them social outcasts within the capital
city.
