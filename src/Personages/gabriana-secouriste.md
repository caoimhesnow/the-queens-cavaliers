:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Gabriana Secouriste is the latest in a long line of cavaliers that dates back to the 11th century.
Even when the Cavaliers were mostly an honorary position, her grandmother and mother took
the job seriously, and they instilled a sense of duty and loyalty into young Gabriana.

Unwaveringly loyal to the Cavaliers and her friends, Gabriana is a cheerful presence
in the Citadel, usually found practicing in the dueling grounds of the Cavaliers' keep.
She served briefly in the Queen's Army before receiving her appointment to the Cavaliers.

In addition to being an expert fencer, Gabriana is also an accomplished singer. Of late, she
has been learning more about her family's roots in Ifran.

::::::::::::::: ally ::::::::::::::::::::::::::
As a cheeful and eager young member of the cavaliers, Gabriana
will easily befriend any player characters who are members of
the Queen's Cavaliers. Her stats can be used to represent any
rank-and-file member of the Cavaliers.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::: enemy :::::::::::::::::::::::::
Gabriana works best as a rival rather than an outright
enemy. Switch her D10 passion from Friends to Pride, and you
have a character who would love to show up any player character
members of the Cavaliers, especially those who don't fit her
standards of what a true Cavalier should be.
