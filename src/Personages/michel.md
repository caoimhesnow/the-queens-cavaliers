# Michel {.cbreakbefore}


Michel Aubene, the prince-father, is the younger brother of Arynne Aubene, the
Duchess of Valerienne. As a young man, he left behind a commission in the Gallinean
navy to join the Queen's Cavaliers. He distinguished himself as a skiled swordsman,
dedicated to the service of the Queen in a way that was uncommon among the Cavaliers of the time.

While assigned as a bodyguard to crown princess Elisse, the dashing duelist caught the
eye of the young princess and a clandestine romance began. Their love didn't stay secret
very long, obvious to the entire court. Eventually, Queen Amarante gave her blessing to
the relationship, to the surprise of Elisse and Michel. 

When Elisse became queen herself, that made Michel the prince-consort; and by tradition,
the honorary head of the Queen's Cavaliers. Under Aubene's predecessors, princes-consort CÃ´me and Henri,
this was a ceremonial position; however, Michel was cut from the same mold as princess-consort Clarisse,
the war-heroine wife of Elisse's great-grandmother and namesake, Queen Elisse II. 
Michel is more responsible than anyone for the transformation of the Queen's Cavaliers from
a club of aging veterans to a thriving, diverse organization with myriad skills to support the crown.

Elisse and Michel had two daughters, crown princess Jehanne and princess Mari. In 1243, an
assassin's bomb killed Elisse and Jehanne, and seriously injured Michel as well. While he
recovered, he blamed himself for not protecting his wife and eldest daughter. During the
year after the assassination, Aubene was prince-regent for the new Queen Mariana II, and is
now the prince-father.

Michel is level-headed and competent, qualities
lacking in his son-in-law, the current Prince-Consort. However,
the Prince-Father is reluctant to interfere in either the ruling
of Gallinea or the management of the Queen's Cavaliers, leaving that
up to Mariana and Carolus. Cavaliers are likely to encounter him
on the training grounds of the Citadel, where he might give them
advice during a fencing lesson, or he could speak to a group of
Cavaliers before they leave Lutetia on a mission, offering a suggestion
as to what their *real* assignment should be.

The deaths of his wife and eldest daughter have left former Cavalier-Captain
Michel Aubene as a shattered husk of a man who spends most of his days
and all of his nights in the taverns closest to the Citadel. The old
days were better, he says, and this new crop of Cavaliers is an embarrassment
to those who have gone before. A bitter and broken Prince Michel could
be an antagonist of the player characters, never fighting them directly
nor engaging in a rivalry, but always making their lives a living hell.
To match the hellish nightmare of his own life.
