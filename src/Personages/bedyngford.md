::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Lord Richard of Bedyngford comes from a long and and distinguished line of Albian
aristrocrats. The younger of the Duke of Bedyngford, he was appointed to
an Ambassadorship to give him something to do. And, some say, to get him out
of Albia where his scandalous behaviour would have fewer consequences for the
Duchy.

Lord-Ambassador Bedyngford is a tall, handsome man with black hair and mustache.
He is usually impeccably dressed and groomed, but he prefers to avoid affairs of
state and other formal affairs. Instead, he would rather go somewhere that he
can be the most attractive, most fabulously dressed, most important person in
the room. His favored haunts in Lutetia are the bars and pubs of the common
parts of town, where he usually spends extravagantly on buying drinks on the house.

Unlike Prince-Consort Carolus, Bedyngford's Gallinean is impeccably proper, 
with barely a hint of an accent. When Carolus arrived in Gallinea, Bedyngford
had been in place for a few years, and took the young Albian prince under his
wing. The two formed a friendship of sorts, with Bedyngford dragging 
Carolus with him on his tavern crawls.

Bedyngford is competitive, vain, and promiscuous; he'll flirt and bed people
of any gender or social class. Although he proudly proclaims his loyalty toward
the patriarchal Albia, he steadfastly refuses any opportunity to return to the
country of his birth, offering as many excuses as necessary. The worldly life
of Lutetia suits him better than the stark moralism of Dunon, Albia's capital.

Bedyngford is loyal to Albia, not to Gallinea. As such,
he could be either a persistent rival or a deadly enemy.
The fact that he has the ear of the Prince-Consort makes
him all that much more dangerous. He may play the role of
a foppish dandy, but is actually a shrewd manipulator.

Player characters who are from Albia will find Bedyngford
to be an affable, agreeable drinking companion. He may ask
them to undertake harmless tasks, nothing important, that
just happen to benefit him or Albia. He can also be a good
source of gossip within the Gallinean and Albian royal courts.
