# Arynne Aubene {.cbreakbefore}

House Aubene is nearly royalty in southern Gallinea, and Duchess Arynne is the
latest of Aubene to lead the richest city in the queendom. At least,
Valeriennes believe their southern Jeweled Coast city to be the wealthiest,
and only Lutetians would dare argue with them.

As a young woman, Arynne studied medicine, and for a year she served as a ship's doctor
on a trading ship owned by her family. She was disappointed when her younger brother
showed no interest in the family fleets or managing the Aubene wealth, but instead
wanted to run off and become a swordfighter.

When her mother stepped down as Duchess of Valerienne, Arynne naturally inherited 
the title. She still dabbles in medicine from time to time, but generally speaking
it's hard for one of the most recognizable faces in Valerienne to find a placement
as a chirurgeon in the trading fleets.

As the older sister of the prince-father, a former Cavalier himself,
Duchess Aubene is likely to regard members of the Queen's Cavaliers
well and offer aid and shelter in Valerienne. She may ask the
Cavaliers to do favors on behalf of her city or its Talanian
refugees.

If the player characters are not acting in the best interests of
Valerienne or Gallinea, they may find that Arynne has banned them
from Valerienne. Anyone actively harming Valerienne -- or Aubene's
younger brother, Michel -- could have a price placed on their head.
Valerienne gold can buy a lot of mercenaries and bounty hunters.
