::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Most Lutetians would describe Carolus, prince-consort of Gallinea and husband to 
Queen Mariana, as hopelessly befuddled. They're not really wrong. 

As the youngest son of King Edgar and Queen Fionna of Albia, he was told it was
his duty to marry the younger daughter of Queen Elisse of Gallinea. His parents
were never the type to take no for an answer, and at their insistence -- plus
that of his older brother, Crown-Prince Edmund -- he agreed to the political
marriage and ended the disastrous Twenty Years' War.

Carolus was totally unprepared for the death of Queen Elisse, and even less for
the expectation that the new Queen's consort was expected to move to Lutetia.
Gallinea's matriarchal, progressive views clashed with those of his upbringing
and his poor proficiency in the Gallinean language made Lutetia seem bewilderingly
alien.

It was during this time that Lord-Ambassador Bedyngford befriended Carolus, as the
only other Albian in courtly circles. Bedyngford serves as a proxy older brother
for the young princeling, and the two are frequent drinking and hunting partners.

Upon become prince-consort, Carolus also learned he was now the honorary
leader of the Queen's Cavaliers. It's an honor he barely understands, and prefers
to spend his time away from Cavaliers if possible. Instead, he spends most of his
time as a patron of the arts, something Mariana has little interest in.

The big tragedy of Carolus's marriage is not the arranged nature of it, but
rather that the prince-consort has fallen in love with the young queen -- and
the love is apparently not reciprocated.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: using :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::: ally :::::::::::::::::::
Carolus means well, really he does. He may stumble through
Gallinean social graces like a bull in a porcelain shop, but his
heart is in the right place. As the ceremonial head of the Queen's
Cavaliers, he is a natural ally for any members of the Cavaliers, and
may need them to help with anything from important matters of state
to going on a fox hunt (with imported foxes).

:::::::::::::: enemy ::::::::::::::::::::::::
Ambassador Bedyngford's sway over the young Albian prince
means that Carolus could easily be convinced that the player
characters are enemies of Gallinea, Albia, or his dear Mariana.
For Cavaliers, this could mean they are stripped of their
position and expelled from the group. For others, they may
find themselves hunted by the Queen's Cavaliers themselves.
