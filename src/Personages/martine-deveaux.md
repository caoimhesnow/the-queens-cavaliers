Martine Deveaux, once known as La Chevalier Rouge, is a former member of the Queen's Cavaliers. By all
accounts she was one of the most promising young members under
Captain Michel Aubene's tutelage. In addition to using her fencing
skills in defense of the queen, she also developed a talent for 
disguise. On several occasions, Deveaux impersonated Mariana as a
decoy for those who would harm the young queen.

Five years ago, something changed. The one-loyal Martine betrayed the
Cavaliers during a disastrous mission, and then disappeared for nearly
a year. When she resurfaced, she was now selling her services as an
assassin and spy, gaining a reputation as one of the most dangerous mercenaries
in Gallinea.

Deveaux has had clandestine dealings with arch-chaplain Farrazin.
The Guardian of the Faith uses her services for missions that cannot
be assigned to his Holy Guardsmen nor can they be linked back to the Cathedral.
In these missions, she often works with the Brothers Duthas, a family of brutish
siblings with a sense of loyalty to the provocateur.

While her loyalties last only as long as the gold holds out, she does take a
special relish in tasks that bring her in conflict with her former compatriots
in the Queen's Cavaliers.

Martine can be either a master schemer or a deadly combatant. With her brutal
henchmen, her conspiratorial ties to Farrazin, and her inside knowledge
of the Queen's Cavaliers, she can present any number of challenges to
player characters. If you want to keep Martine alive in the face of
determinedly murderous Cavaliers, borrow a trick from old movie serials
by having her fall off a cliff into a waterfall, her body never found.

We don't actually tell you why Martine left the Queen's Cavaliers.
That's for each individual MJ to fill in, or not fill in, as she
wishes. What if rather than being a villain, Martine has a point
about the Cavaliers? What if they're corrupt from the inside and
are, in fact, a danger to Gallinea? What if Martine is the only true
patriot and the last, secret defense of Queen Mariana against her real
enemies?
