She never asked for any of this. All Princess Mari wanted to do was study science, and
possibly even become guildmistress of the Mechanicians' Guild. Her older sister Jehanne had
been trained from birth to succeed their mother Elisse as queen of Gallinea, freeing
Mari to work on her clockworks and calculations.

When the Albians proposed a political marriage as an end to the Twenty Years' War, 
Mari was skeptical but was reassured that she wouldn't have to deal much with the
young prince Carolus, who barely spoke Gallinean and resided in Dunon. "As long as I can
ignore him and get back to my research, I don't care," she told her mother, the Queen.

Then both the future of the Gallinean Queendom and Mari's life changed in an instant.
As she smoke cleared, Mari found her mother dead and her sister dying. When the crown princess
died, the throne passed to Mari, Elisse's only other daughter. Although token protest was
raised in the Parliament of Nobles, Gallineans mourning their beloved Queen Elisse supported
Princess Mari, now Queen Mariana II, taking the throne when she came of age. Her father, 
former prince-consort Michel Aubene, served as regent for a year until that happened.

Political scheming never interested Mariana, although as a princess in the Royal Palace
she had an extensive cultural education and could speak intelligently on Gallinea's issues.
Queen Elisse was a reformer, who had a grand vision for changing the Queendom in ways
that would benefit all of Gallinea; Mariana's style may be different, but she is no less
dedicated to progressive reform than her mother. Queen Mariana sees Gallinea as a riddle to be solved:
a giant clockwork puzzle-box with interlocking gears that must be carefully calibrated and maintained.

Queen Mariana and her husband, prince-consort Carolus, have no children at present, a cause of
concern among some Traditionalist nobles. It's said that Mariana tolerates Carolus but does not
love him; he, on the other hand, seems absolutely smitten with his brilliant Gallinean wife.

Mariana is, of course, the titular queen of *The Queen's
Cavaliers*. With the pressures of running a major
country thrust into her lap unexpectly, Mariana doesn't have
time to oversee whatever player charcters get up to, but she
has a good memory and will remember any Cavalier who distinguishes
herself. Mariana's father is a former Cavalier, and if they
can get access to her -- which may be an adventure in and of itself --
she tends to treat Cavalier characters kindly and respectfully.

Maybe the worst predictions of the Traditionalists have
come true -- Elisse's younger daughter is fully unprepared for
the role she's taken on, and is going to drive the entire country
of Gallinea into ruin. Easily manipulated by everyone from her
scoundrel uncle to the Albian ambassador, she's an imcompetent
puppet who needs to be removed and replaced. Who will step
forward and be a true Gallinean patriot?
