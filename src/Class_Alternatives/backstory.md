## Random Backstories {.breakbefore} ## 

This is an optional method of character creation that allows you to roll
randomly on a series of tables (or, with your MJ's permission, pick from
the lists) to determine your character's backstory, starting skills, and
proficiencies.

This system replaces the part of the character creation process where
you choose two classes.

When you gain a specialty, you also gain competency in the appropriate
skill. For example, if a result reads “Culture (Scholarship +1),” you
gain competency in the Culture skill if you didn't have it before, and
you gain one rank in the Scholarship specialty.

As a starting character, you are limited to a maximum of +2 ranks in any
specialty. If a random roll would increase your ranks to +3 or higher,
the additional points are added to your customizations which you can
spend later in the character creation process.

Because you don't have a class, you can't spend your customizations on
additional style maneuvers during the character creation process, apart
from national styles. (When you gain enough XP, you can take any style
maneuver later.)

### Regional or National Origin

Roll 1D12 to determine where you were born, your native language(s), and
the skills you picked up at an early age from your culture. Alternately,
if you know you want to be from Gallinea itself, just roll 1D4.

:# Backstory-Based Character Creation

Dani decides to roll up a character using the optional random backstory
system instead of choosing two classes.

:# Regional or National Origin

Dani rolls a 12 on the table, meaning she's from Varendia. She adds the
Varendish language and the skills Military and Nature to her character
sheet.

:# Parentage

With a roll of 8, one of Dani's parents was a retired Cavalier. She adds
the Gallinean langague, skill competency in Dueling, one rank in Lunge,
prowess with swords, and the style maneuver Confident Fencing to her
character sheet. She also sets her D6 passion to Loyalty.

Dani also has to answer the question, “What notable deed did your parent
perform in the name of the Queen?” Dani decides that her mother stopped
an Albian airship from bombing Castenia during the Twenty Years' War.

:# Pivotal Event of Childhood

Rolling a d8, Dani gets a 1, and finds that someone in her family died.
She decides this was her father, and that his unexpected death caused
her to grow up quickly. She adds one rank to Intuition, and sets her D8
Passion to Family.

In answer to the question “What did your relative tell you before they
died?” Dani decides that her dying father told her to never turn her
back on someone in need.

:# Education

Dani rolls a result of 11 on the education table, meaning that she
attended the royal universities in Lutetia. This gives her the Gallinean
language, but she already speaks it. She also gains competency in
Culture; one skill rank each in Etiquette, Scholarship, Negotiate, and
Deduce; Knowledge as a D10 passion; and the Cunning Erudition style
maneuver.

To answer the question “Why did a stranger pay for your expensive
education?” she decides that the Duchess of Castenia paid for her
education in recognition of her mother's bravery during the last war.

:# Pivotal Event of Adulthood

Dani rolls a 1 on the final table, getting “Clandestinely Recruited.”
This gives her competency in Medicine and Streetwise, and one rank each
in Deceive, Prowl, Poison, and Carouse. She also gains Country as a D12
passion and Do You Expect Me To Talk? as a style maneuver.

“What have you learned that makes you mistrust your superiors?” Dani
distrusts her superior because she has been asked to spy on her fellow
members of the Queen's Cavaliers.

:# Backstory Summary

Dani was born in Varendia to a Gallinean mother and a Varendish father.
Her mother had distinguished herself during the war between Albia and
Gallinea, and when she had completed her duty to the Queen, she married
a man in Varendia and settled down. Tragically, Dani's father passed
away when she was young and she was raised by her mother.

Dani returned to Gallinea when she was old enough to study at the royal
universities in Lutetia, with her education paid for by a grateful noble
who remembered her mother's courage. Upon graduation, Dani was accepted
into the Queen's Cavaliers as a new recruit, and was also contacted by
Prince Jean-Remy, the Queen's uncle and spymaster, and asked to report
back to him on the actions of her fellow cavaliers.
