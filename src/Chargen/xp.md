## Experience Points

Each session of *The Queen's Cavaliers*, the MJ awards experience points
based on the following table. If faster progression is desired – for
example, in a campaign with limited sessions – the MJ can increase the
rewards by a factor of up to three.

Table: XP rewards per session

|                        |                  |
| :--------------------- | :--------------- |
| Base Per Sesssion      | 1 XP per session |
| Each Major Scene       | 1 XP per scene   |
| Storyline Resolution   | 1 XP             |
| Faster Leveling        | x2 or x3         |

You can spend your experience points to add new abilities to your
character or improve current abilities, as shown on the table below. You
must have Competency in a Skill to increase your Specialty rank, and
your Style Maneuvers can be chosen from your own classes, from your
National Styles, or from other classes with the MJ's approval. Your
Specialty ranks cannot be increased beyond +2 until your Competency Die
increases (see the following section).

Table: Character improvements

| Character Element          | Cost                  | Notes                  |
| :------------------------  | :-------------------: | :--------------------- |
| New Skill Competency       | 3 XP                  |                        |
| Specialty Rank, per rank:  |                       | Equal to the new rank  |
|  +0 to +1                  | 1 XP                  |                        |
|  +1 to +2                  | 2 XP                  | (3 XP from +0 to +2)   |
|  +2 to +3                  | 3 XP                  | (6 XP from +0 to +3)   |
|  +3 to +4                  | 4 XP                  | (10 XP from +0 to +4)  |
|  +4 to +5                  | 5 XP                  | (15 XP from +0 to +5)  |
| New Language               | 1 XP                  |                        |
| Weapon Prowess             | 1 XP                  |                        |
| Armor Prowess              | 1 XP                  |                        |
| Add a Style Maneuver       | 5 XP                  |                        |

Once you have spent at least 20 XP to improve your character, your
Competency Die increases to a D8, and your limit for Specialty ranks
increases to +3. Additional expenditures of XP increase your Competency
Die and Specialty rank limit further, as shown below.

Remember to adjust your Yield Limit each time your Competency Die increases.

Table: XP spent and competency dice

| XP Spent | Competency Die | Maximum Specialty Rank |
| :------: | :------------: | :--------------------: |
| 0        | D6             |  +2                    |
| 20       | D8             |  +3                    |
| 50       | D10            |  +4                    |
| 100      | D12            |  +5                    |

effort in activities relevant to your XP expenditure.
