# Pick Classes

Your character in *The Queen's Cavaliers* is a composite of two classes.
Each class provides you with half of your starting skill competencies,
specialties, weapon and armor prowess, social rank, starting gear, and
style Maneuvers. For full descriptions of each class, <a href="#classes" class="xref-seechapter">Classes</a>.

Th 24 core classes in *The Queen's Cavaliers* can be divided up into three basic categories:
skilled classes, social classes, and fighting classes. These are shown
on the following tables.

For the most well-rounded character, choose a fighting class and either
skilled or social class; that way, you'll be effective in a fight as
well as outside of one. Duelist is a good choice for a fighting class,
if you can't find another that doesn't really fit.

If you are mainly interested in creating things or helping people, you
can choose one skilled class and one social class, or two skilled
classes.

To make a mostly social character, choose a social class and a skilled
class, or two social classes.

Finally, if you want to build a character who excels at combat but not
at much else, choose two fighting classes.

You don't have to choose your classes if you don't feel inspired;
instead you can roll 1D8 for each one. Feel free to reroll if you don't
like your original results!

Your classes determine your starting Skill Competencies and your Specialty ranks. 

You have Competency in every skill listed on either or both of your classes. There are
a total of 12 skills in *The Queen's Cavaliers*, which are described <a href="#skills-and-specialties" class="xref-inchapter">Skills and Specialties</a>
and summarized in the following table.

Table: Skills

| Skill              | Use                                                   |

Verve, Affinity, and Guile. For example, the three specialties for Culture are Arts,

For every Specialty listed under each class, you gain +1 Specialty rank in that
specialty. If a Specialty is listed under both classes, then you gain +2 ranks
instead of +1.

## Weapon & Armor Prowess

Each class grants you Armor and Weapon Prowess that determine whether you can use
those items. You can add the Item Die of armor or weapons to a dice pool if either
or both of your classes list that prowess.

The Weapon Prowess categories are:

Table: Weapon Prowess

Weapons and armor are described in more detail <a href="#equipment" class="xref-inchapter">Equipment</a>.

## Classes and Social Rank

Each class lists a social rank, such as Commoner (D0) or Artisan (D8). The social ranks are:

Table: Social Rank

| Social Rank        | Social Rank Die | Examples                                            |
| :----------------- | :-------------: | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Commoner           | D0              | Provincials, speakers, bandits                      |
| Soldier            | D6              | Veterans, duelists, privateers, dragoons            |
| Artisan            | D8              | Mechanicians, alchemists, charmweavers, chirurgeons |
| Noble              | D10             | Courtiers, nobles, barristers                       |
| Royalty            | D12             | Members of the royal family                         |

Your total social rank is a combination of both of these social ranks. For example, if one
class has the rank of Commoner (D0) and the other has Artisan (D8), then your overall
social rank is Artisan (D8) / Commoner (D0).

## Bonus Gear from Classes

Each class provides you with a set of clothing and possibly additional equipment. You gain
the bonus gear from both of your classes. For descriptions of gear, 
<a href="#equipment" class="xref-seechapter">Equipment</a>.

# Select Style Maneuvers

Style Maneuvers are special abilities that let you reroll or enhance your dice rolls. Each of
your classes lists between five and seven associated style maneuvers. Choose one Style Maneuver
from each of your classes.

Style maneuvers are described <a href="#style-maneuvers" class="xref-inchapter">Style Maneuvers</a>.

# Assign Attributes

Attributes describe the way your character chooses to address challenges or obstacles, and are
used in your specialty dice pools. Each attribute corresponds to one specialty per skill. The three
attributes are:

- **Verve**, which signifies a straightforward approach to challenges. A character with a high Verve
  usually uses the most direct, and often brute-force, method to solve a problem.

- **Affinity** describes an attempt to understand and analyze challenges before taking action. A
  character with a high Affinity will attempt to find deeper meaning behind difficulties when resolving
  them.

- **Guile** designates the ability to think outside of the box. Characters with high Guile favor
  unorthodox, clever solutions to challenges that might elude a straight-forward or carefully considered approach.

Attributes are rated by dice sizes: D6, D8, or D10. The higher the die size, the more that
any given character uses that particular attribute.

When you create your character, you assign D6, D8, and D10 to your three attributes. Each die
size can be assigned to only one attribute.

- **D10** should be assigned to the Attribute that best describes your character's mindset.

- **D6** should be assigned to the Attribute that least applies to your character.

- **D8** should be assigned to the remaining attribute.

# Choose Nationality & Languages

Your character's nationality determines her native language and general cultural background. Most characters in *The
Queen's Cavaliers* are from Gallinea. You can roll on the next table if you wish to randonly choose a non-Gallinean nationality.

The countries of Elara and Ifran are roughly analogous to those of Europe and Northern Africa, although most are a 
combination of two or more real-world countries, as shown in the following table:

Table: Common Nationalities

| D12 | Country                   | Language                         | Analogue(s)                                     |
| :-: | :------------------------ | :-------------------------       | :--------------------------------               |
| --  | Gallinea                  | Gallinea                         | France, Belgium                                 |
| 1-2 | Albia                     | Albian                           | England, Ireland, Scotland                      |
|  3  | Dragosa                   | Ekalian, Varendish, and Talanian | Switzerland, Hungary, Albania                   |

| 7-8 | Ondala                    | Ondalese                         | Spain, Portugal                                 |
| 9-10| Talania                   | Talanian                         | Russia, Poland                                  |
|11-12| Varendia                  | Varendish                        | Germany, Austria                                |
| --  | Western Ifran             | Gallinean, Albian, or Ondalese   | European colonies in the Americas and Australia |

Your character knows one language from your country of origin; for example Gallineans are fluent in speaking, reading,
and writing Gallinean.  For each specialty rank you have in Culture (Scholarship), you know an additional language.

Most games of *The Queen's Cavaliers* are set in Gallinea, and so you might want to learn Gallinean if it's not your native
language.

The country of Gallinea is described 
<a href="#atlas-of-gallinea" class="xref-inchapter">Atlas of Gallinea</a>;
<a href="#history-of-gallinea" class="xref-chaptername">History of Gallinea</a>; and
<a href="#gallinean-culture" class="xref-chaptername">Gallinean Culture</a>.

and <a href="#the-colonies-of-west-ifran" class="xref-chaptername">Colonies of West Ifran</a>.

# Determine Passions 

Passions describe people, places, and principles that shape your character's life and personal values. The standard passions are
described <a href="#passions" class="xref-insection">Passions</a> and summarized in the following table:

Table: Standard Passions

| Passion            | Description                                         |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------           |
| Artistry           | Delight in the creation of beauty or utility        |
| Church             | The people and structure of a religious community   |
| Country            | One's nation or city-state, from birth or by choice |
| Faith              | Deeply held spiritual or religious convictions      |
| Family             | The family into which one is born or adopted        |
| Friends            | Peers with whom one chooses to associate            |
| Justice            | Higher ideals as to right, wrong, and fairness      |
| Knowledge          | Pursuit of information and learning                 |
| Love               | Romantic or emotional attraction to others          |
| Loyalty            | Steadfast support of a person or group              |
| Lust               | Desire for pleasures of the flesh                   |
| Pride              | Satisfaction in one's accomplishments or identity   |
| Wealth             | Acculumation and retention of money and property    |

Some passions are *reversed* and imply a strong rejection of the standard passion. For example, someone who
has a passion of Wealth, Reversed might live a life of voluntary poverty and give away their possessions to
the poor, while someone with Family, Reverse could hate their relatives and wish to destroy their family fortunes.

Your character has four passions that are most important in her life. Each is rated by a die size, starting with
D12 -- the passion that most strongly affects her life -- and then D10, D8, and D6 for the weakest of her four
passions.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: optional :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For each Passion, you can name one person associated as the 
Personification of that associated passion. This is the
person (living or dead) whom your character most closely associates with
that Passion, either positively or negatively. You can use an existing
NPC (or even PC), or name a new one.

# Purchase Additional Equipment

Your character's starting equipment consists of whichever bonus gear is listed
under each of her classes, plus one basic weapon of your choice. This can 
be one of the weapons shown on the following table:

Table: Free Starting Weapon

| Weapon           | Prowess Category | Description                                 |

third is your Competency Die, which is 1D6. You can spend each Reward die to purchase
an item with a cost equal to or less than the size of the Reward Die. For example,
a 1D8 reward die be used to purchase any item of cost 1D8, 1D6, or 1D0.

# Set Character Details

There are two types of details you need record: those related to your character's game stats, and those
related to your character's identity in the world of Gallinea.

## Game Details

As a starting character, you have a Competency die of 1D6, unless otherwise specified by your Maitresse de Jeu.
Some MJs may wish to run games in which you have a higher or lower starting Competency die, but the default is
1D6.

There are two types of "damage" in *The Queen's Cavaliers:* Yield and Wounds. Wounds are the most lethal; any
character who takes four or more wounds is dying and will perish unless they receive immediate medical aid.

Your Yield Limit represents the point at which your character will bow out of a fight due to becoming discouraged, exhausted,
or intimidated. Your Yield Limit is 3 plus the maximum value of your Competency die, for a total of 9 in most cases.

Experience points, abbreviated as "XP", measure your character's growth in their skills and talents. As you play
*The Queen's Cavaliers*, you will gain XP and can spend those to increase your Specialty Ranks, learn new Weapon or

required. Some of the most common names in Gallinea are listed in the following table; you can roll 1D12 to choose
a name randomly if you wish.

Most characters in Gallinea have a gender, and it's usually either female or male. The default assumption in
