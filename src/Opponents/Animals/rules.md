### Animal Attributes and Specialties

While humans have Verve, Affinity, and Guile as attributes, animals are
defined by the attributes Instinct, Ferocity, and Training. These can
range from D0 to D12, and aren't assigned as D10/D8/D6 as for human
characters.

Animals don't have skills, but each specialty is grouped under an
appropriate attribute. There is one specialty, Perceive, that is
classified as any attribute, and the Initiative skill has three new
Specialties that don't apply to humans.

#### Instinct

Instinctive specialties are those related to the survival of the animal,
such as self-preservation or locating food.

**Dodge:** This is used by most animals to avoid attacks.

**Explore:** The Explore specialty is used for tracking, finding
shelter, locating edible plants, or finding water.

**Feint:** An animal will use Feint primarily to distract, although
there are some faster animals which use it for attack.

**Flee (Initiative specialty):** For 1 Initiative Point, the animal can
Walk to an unoccupied area, and for 2 Initiative Points, it can Run to
an unoccupied area. None of the human options for Initiative are
available, such as Interpose, Reprise, or Seize the Initiative.

**Perceive:** This can fall under any animal Attribute. Animals use the
skill just as humans do, but they often have senses that can be added on
as an Item Die.

**Prowl:** Animals that sneak up on targets, or hide from predators, are
using the Prowl specialty.

#### Ferocity Specialties

The Ferocity attribute is a measure of an animal's aggression,
determination, and fortitude. They're primarily used offensively.

**Brawl:** Animals use the Brawl specialty to grab hold of things, knock
them down, or pin them to the ground.

**Fight (Initiative specialty):** For 1 Initiative Point, the animal can
Seize the Initiative and immediately make a Lunge attack. For 2
Initiative Points, it can Seize the Initiative and make a Brawl or
Riposte attack. It can't use Initiative Points for any other purpose.

**Inspire:** Pack alphas often are able to Inspire bravery in their
packmates, but most commonly this specialty is used to Inspire fear and
scare off other creatures.

**Lunge:** This is an aggressive attack using the natural weapons
possessed by the animal, such as claws, sharp teeth, or horns. Those
natural weapons add their Weapon die to Lunge attacks.

**Perceive:** This can fall under any animal Attribute. Animals use the
skill just as humans do, but they often have senses that can be added on
as an Item Die.

**Riposte:** Animals don't Parry attacks, but they might be able to
Riposte on a good Dodge roll or by using Initiative Points.

#### Training Specialties

Training specialties are things that animals must be taught or trained
to do. This usually means being taught by humans, but sometimes wild
animals are taught by other animals of the same type.

**Arts:** While very few animals actually create works of art, many
birds will use the Art specialty to sing.

**Block:** Sometimes an animal will have a tough enough hide or shell to
be able to use the Block specialty. This can also be used by animals
that are actually wearing some kind of armor, from horse barding to
spiked collars. The animal can add the shell or armor's Armor Die to its
Block pool.

**Guard (Initiative):** For 1 Initiative Point, the animal can Interpose
itself to prevent a creature from entering its area. For 2 Initiative
Points, the animal can make a Lunge, Brawl, or Feint attack against a
creature that enters its area. The animal can't spend its Initiative
Points on anything else.

**Husbandry:** This specialty is primarily possessed by working animals,
such as dogs that herd sheep or oxen that pull plows.

**Larceny:** Only a very few animals, such as ravens, can actually use
Larceny to steal objects. Naturally, animals can't make use of the black
market.

**Perceive:** This can fall under any animal Attribute. Animals use the
skill just as humans do, but they often have senses that can be added on
as an Item Die.

### Scale

Instead of a Competency Die, animals have a Scale Die that relates to
how large they are. Scale also determines the yield limit and wound
limit for the animal. For yield limits, "half Ferocity" means "half of
the die size", and "Ferocity" means "the die
size."

*(table) Scale of Animals*
| Scale     | Scale Die | Yield Limit        | Wound Limit                                       |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Pocket    | \--       | 1                  | 1 (Dead)                                          |
| Pet       | 1D0       | 2 + half Ferocity  | 1 (Dying)                                         |
| Companion | 1D6       | 3 + half Ferocity  | 2 (Drop 1, Dying)                                 |
| Human     | 1D8       | 4 + half Ferocity  | 3 (Drop 1, Drop 2, Dying)                         |
| Mount     | 1D10      | 5 + Ferocity       | 4 (Drop 1, Drop 2, Drop 4, Dying)                 |
| Mammoth   | 1D12      | 6 + Ferocity       | 5 (Drop 0, Drop 1, Drop 2, Drop 4, Dying)         |
| Behemoth  | 2D12      | 7 + twice Ferocity | 6 (Drop 0, Drop 0, Drop 1, Drop 2, Drop 4, Dying) |

**Pocket scale:** This is the smallest category of animal -- one that
could be carried in a pocket. Examples include a rat, a songbird, or a
tarantula.

**Pet scale:** A pet-scale animal is around the size of a housecat or a
small dog. Too big for a pocket, it can still be carried in one hand.
Some examples are a trained parrot, a rooster, or a rabbit.

**Companion scale:** A companion-scale animal isn't quite as large as a
human, but rather about the size of a medium to large dog. It takes both
hands or arms to carry a companion-scale animal. Examples include a
goat, a hunting dog, or a venomous snake.

**Human scale:** Human-scale animals are approximately the size and
weight of an adult human being. Some examples are a war dog, a ram, or a
constrictor snake.

**Mount scale:** Animals that are large enough to be ridden by a single
human, or perhaps two or three with a tight squeeze, are mount scale.
Examples include a warhorse, a bear, or a cow.

**Mammoth scale:** Even larger than mount scale, mammoth-scale animals
include orca, hordes, and elephants. They take up pretty much a
normal-sized room.

**Behemoth scale:** The largest of animals are behemoth scale. There are
few of these left since the days of dragons (or dinosaurs; nobody's
quite sure which it is). The most notable examples of behemoth-scale
animals are found in the oceans -- such as a great whale or a giant
squid.

#### Hordes

A horde is a swarm or pack of similar animals that work as one unit for
game purposes. If 300 rats flood out into the sewers, you don't really
want to make individual rolls for all of them whenever they attack or
defend.

A horde has an additional Attribute, called Horde. This is a measure of
the horde's consistency and cooperation. All Horde attributes start at
D12.

The horde uses its Horde attribute as a Bonus Die in all of its die
pools. However, when the horde takes wounds, the Horde die decreases to
a D10, a D8, a D6, a D0, and then disperses. This replaces the normal
Drop/Dying/Dead effects of wounds.

Most hordes are mammoth scale, although hordes of larger animals (such
as sharks) might be behemoth scale, and smaller hordes such as a swarm
of honeybees could be merely mount scale.

### Other Animal Qualities

Many of the game qualities of animals are similar to those of human
characters. These are some of the ways they differ.

#### Movement

A human can Walk 1 area, or Run 2 areas. Some animals are faster than
this, and some are slower. The Walk and Run qualities tell you how many
areas the animal can move using each type of action.

Some animals have special types of movement that humans can't do, such
as flying, swimming, or climbing. These allow an animal to move between
Areas in ways that most humans can't.

#### Senses

Many animals have superior senses to humans; these are shown by the
Senses quality. When using the specific type of sense, the animal can
add that die on as an Item Die to Perceive rolls.

In addition, animals can use their best Attribute for calculating their
Perceive pools, as Perceive is associated with Instinct, Ferocity, and
Training.

#### Weapons and Armor

Whether an animal has built-in weapons or armor -- such as sharp teeth
or a hard carapace -- or is wearing an actual weapon or armor --
barding, a spiked collar, and so on -- it works the same way: the Item
Die can be added to whatever skills are specified.

#### Maneuvers

Animals don't gain style points. They don't need them, so don't spend
any of their success points to buy style points. They don't even know
any style maneuvers anyway.

Instead they have conditional maneuvers that just happen whenever the
condition is fulfilled.

For example, a great shark has the following maneuver: Blood in the
Water (when attacking a target with at least 1 wound, add Perceive +1D12
to Lunge). This happens whenever it attacks a wounded target. No style
points, no limited uses -- just whenever the condition applies, it comes
into play.

#### Impetus

Animals don't have passions. They're just animals, and concepts like
Justice or Faith don't really mean much to them. Instead, they have an
Impetus -- or maybe more than one Impetus.

These are the urges that drive an animal to action, much as passions do,
but on a much more primal level.

Impetus types include:

**Curiosity:** The animal just wants to know what's going on over there,
or across the way, or what's behind the door. And it's not like
Curiosity ever killed any animals, right?

**Hunger:** All animals are concerned with eating, but those with a
Hunger Impetus will prioritize food and eating over nearly every other
activity.

**Loyalty: **An animal with a Loyalty Impetus is a faithful companion to
a human, usually its trainer or owner. They're a human's best friend.

**Obedience:** A domesticated animal with the Obedience Impetus follows
commands given to it. Not because it even likes the person giving the
commands, but rather because it's that well trained.

**Pack:** The Pack Impetus represents those animals that stick together
as a group, usually in some kind of hierarchy or family units.

**Predatory: **A Predatory animal loves to hunt. Not just because it
needs food, but because it's actually a vicious hunter that likes to
track down its prey.

**Survival: **This is the most basic Impetus: the animal wants to stay
alive. It will take any action necessary to do so, with the only
exception being if it has a higher rated Impetus of another kind.

**Territory:** A territorial animal will likely attack, or at least
attempt to frighten off, other creatures that come within its territory.

You can use Impetus as you would use Passions -- an animal can use each
Impetus it possesses once in a story, and then it loses that specific
Impetus. You can only use an Impetus if the animal's actions are
directly related to that Impetus.

For example, if an animal has a Survival (D6) Impetus, you can add that
Bonus Die once to a Dodge pool or other defensive roll. A Predatory
Impetus could be used for tracking or spotting something, an Obedience
Impetus for staying alert, or a Curiosity Impetus for staying hidden
while investigating some shiny new thing.
