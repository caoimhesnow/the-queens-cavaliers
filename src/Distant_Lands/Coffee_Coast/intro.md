::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The country on southern coast of the Eastern Sea is known to the people of Gallinea
as "The Coffee Coast," but the correct name is actually "Kheffika." It's from Kheffika
that Elarans were first exposed to coffee, and the Gallinean word "coffee" (*caf√©* in 
Old Gallinean) is in fact derived from the name of the country.

Apart from being a source of imported coffee, however, the Gallineans have no idea
what the Kheffites are like and what they do.
