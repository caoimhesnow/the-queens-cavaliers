# Combat # 

Combat is initiated when either party wants to begin a physical conflict. 

## Actions Before Combat

Before combat actually begins, depending on the circumstances, a
character may able to take certain actions to gain benefits in the
upcoming fight.

These actions can include drawing weapons, drinking alchemical draughts,
shouting for help, and so on.

The only dice actions a character can take are those which will give the
character Advantage in the combat – such as a Prowl roll or a Strategy
roll. All Success Points from such rolls can only be spent on Advantage,
and only one roll of a given type can be made. Success Points from these
rolls cannot be spent on gaining Style Points. (See later in this
chapter for more about Advantage.)

### Surprise

The MJ can decide that one side is surprised or otherwise unprepared for
a fight. An Observation roll can be used for this purpose, or the MJ can
simply rule based on the narrative.

If a character is surprised, she is unable to take any preparatory
actions before the fight, so cannot gain Advantage or prepare weapons
before the fight. In addition, she gains a Drop 1 penalty on Initiative
rolls (see below).

## Rolling Initiative

At the start of combat, all combatants make an Initiative roll to
determine the order in which each one will act. There are three
Specialties under the Initiative skill, and the player (or MJ, for NPCs)
can choose which one to use: Impulse, Vigilance, or Timing. This is a
normal Skill roll, where the top two dice are added together for a
total, and the lower of those two dice is the potential number of
successes.

Initiative rolls are automatic successes, which means that there are no
opposition dice and the Success Points are counted as if the roll had
succeeded. Success Points from an Initiative roll are called Initiative
Points and can be spent during the course of the combat as described
below.

Once all combatants have made an Initiative roll, the MJ orders the
results based first on the total roll, and the number of successes to
break ties. If two characters roll the same total and number of
successes, then roll off using 1D10 until the tie is broken.

When each character's turn comes up in the Initiative order, she can
take one action, and then the turn passes to the next player in order.
When all characters have taken a turn, the round ends and starts again
with the first player in Initiative order.

If a new combatant enters a fight already in progress, she rolls
Initiative and is added into the Initiative order at the appropriate
place in the next round.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: toolbox :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### Identical NPCs

When Rabble or Stock Characters are used in quantities of more than two, the MJ can
group them together with one Initiative roll. All combatants in the
group will take their actions at the same place in the Initiative
sequence. Any Initiative Points spent apply to only one of such grouped
characters at a given time.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Spending Initiative Points

There are three ways to use Initiative Points during the course of a
combat scene:

- Seize the Initiative
- Interpose
- Reprise Attack

Each has a cost that varies depending on the Specialty used for the
Initiative roll – for example, if a character used Impulse, it would
cost her one Initiative Point to Seize the Initiative, two points to
Interpose, and three points to Reprise Attack.

**Seize the Initiative:** For one round, the character jumps ahead in the
Initiative order, before someone else is about to act. The next round,
the character acts at her normal place in the Initiative order.

**Interpose:** For one attack, the character makes herself the target of
someone else's attack, instead of the attacker's intended target. This
can be used to protect any target in the same Area, or as a combined
action with a Move to protect a target in an adjacent Area. Alternately,
an Interpose can be used to prevent an opponent in the same Area from
leaving that Area; this blocks the opponent's movement but does not
redirect the attack. A character can Interpose only once per round.

**Reprise Attack:** If the character failed on an attack roll, she can
repeat the attack. This can't be used after a successful attack. A
character can Reprise Attack only once per round.

## Areas and Positioning

Positioning and movement in *The Queen's Cavaliers* are represented by Areas; each Area is a
distinct location where characters might find themselves, as determined
by the MJ.

Before a fight breaks out, the MJ should define these Areas and the
interrelations between them. For example, if one Area is a dock, another
Area might be the deck of a ship. The MJ could say that travel is
possible from the dock to the deck by both the gangplank and the ropes
tying the ship to the dock.

Areas are usually represented by 3x5 index cards or by drawing
rectangles on a piece of paper. Tokens, miniatures, or other small
objects can be used to represent the locations of each combatant, and
moved from Area to Area as the combat progresses.

An example of the Areas for a complex fight is shown above as it may be
laid out with 3x5 cards; in addition, lines are given to show the usual
ways in which a character could move from one Area to another.

What if a character in the Crow's Nest wants to dive off into the water,
or land on the docks? The MJ can judge these exceptions on a
case-by-case basis, generally erring on the side of allowing characters
to move around relatively freely.

But what if someone wants to enter the captain's quarters? That room
isn't shown in the original setup – but if it makes sense to exist,
based on the fictional circumstances of the game, the MJ can add an
additional rectangle or index card to represent this new Area on the
fly, and point out how it can be entered or left.

The primary way to move between Areas is by using the Move action,
either by itself in a turn or as a combined action (see below for
details).

## Actions in Combat

Each time a combatant's turn comes up in the Initiative order, she can
take up to one action. An action involves making an opposed dice roll of
some kind, such as an attack or using a skill, or making another action
that affects the shared fictional world such as moving.

The list of actions that can be taken includes:

- Attack a Foe
- Assist a Friend
- Flourish to Gain Style
- Focus to Reroll Initiative
- Movement
- Prepare an Action
- Reload your Weapon
- Use a Skill

Minor actions are possible, such as drawing a weapon, mounting a horse,
or opening a door. Most of those can simply be done as a combined action
(see below), although you could also do that on your turn as your entire
turn.

### Combined Actions

Many actions can be combined together with other actions. These actions
don't require a dice roll, but instead impose a Drop Penalty on the
primary action's roll.

For example, if you wish to draw your weapon, you could take an action
to do that. Or you could combine drawing the weapon with making an
attack with it.

“Draw a weapon” is a Drop 1 combined action. This means you'd take a
Drop 1 penalty on whatever roll you choose to make that turn as your
action.

Drop Penalties for combined actions are cumulative; if you move to an
adjacent area (another Drop 1 penalty) along with drawing your weapon,
you now have a Drop 2 penalty on your attack.

A partial list of combined actions is shown below:

- **Drop 0:** Drop Weapon
- **Drop 1:** Move, Stand Up, Dismount, Draw Weapon, Sheathe Weapon, Switch Hands, Imbibe Draught, Arm Grenade
- **Drop 2:** Run, Retrieve Weapon, Improvise Weapon, Mount Horse, Reload (Pistol), Reload (Crossbow)
- **Drop 3:** Reload (Musket)

If a desired combined action isn't listed, the MJ can assign an appropriate Drop Penalty based on the examples listed above.

You can never combine two or more actions that require a dice roll, such as two attacks.

If you choose to not take an action that requires a dice roll, you can
instead take multiple combined actions, up to a total of Drop 4. For
example, reloading a pistol (Drop 2), dismounting (Drop 1), and moving
(Drop 1). You wouldn't be able to also drink a draught in the same turn,
because that would impose a Drop 5 penalty. (This limit only applies to
Drop Penalties resulting from combined actions, and not from Wounds.)

### List of Actions

The following actions require the use of your action during a turn, although some can be used as combined actions where noted.

#### Attack

Your character makes an attack against a target, using a Dueling skill
(Lunge or Feint) or a Military Skill (Aim or Brawl). Your character must
be within range of the target, or in the same Area for Dueling and Brawl
attacks, although you could use a combined Move action to get closer to
the target.

Your character's target then gets to choose a specific Defense skill to
use to react to the attack, and an opposed roll is made. The winner of
the opposed roll gets to spend her Success Points as appropriate for the
skill she used.

#### Assist

You can assist another character by taking an Assist action. This grants
the other character bonus dice on their next roll equal to one of the
following:

- Your character's Specialty dice, if she has ranks in the Specialty she is going to use.
- Your character's Competency Die if she doesn't have ranks in the Specialty but is competent in that skill
- 1D6

A character can only receive the benefit from an Assist from two other
characters. If the benefit is not used by the end of the current round,
the benefit is lost.

**As a Combined Action:** You can't combine an Assist with other actions
that require a dice roll, but you can use it with combined actions.
Assist counts as a Drop 2 penalty when comparing against the maximum
amount of Drop from combined actions (Drop 4).

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You want to assist another player in attacking an opponent with
Feint. Your character has 2 ranks in Feint, D8 for Guile, and a D8
Competency Die. You can give one of the following bonuses by assisting
her:

- 2D8 for the Feint specialty dice
- 1D8 for the Competency Die
- 1D6 as a default

Obviously in this case, you would choose the 2D8.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Flourish

A Flourish is an attempt to show off your character's talents in a way
that is impressive – and which nets you Style Points.

To execute a Flourish, choose one specialty and describe how your
character is using it stylishly, as with gaining a Skill Point. Then
make a skill roll against Easy (3D6) opposition. If you are successful,
you can only spend your Success Points on gaining Style Points, up to a
maximum (as always) of three.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You have no Style Points and make a Flourish based on your
character's Dodge specialty. You roll a 14 with seven Success Points
against an opposition roll of 9, succeeding in the roll. You can only
spend your Success Points on gaining Style Points (at a cost of three
Success Points each Style Point) and describe your character leaping
onto a chair, a table, and then a barrel, looking quite dashing as she
does. 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Focus

A Focus is a re-centering of your character's attention, and allows you
to reroll an Initiative roll with no opposition roll. You gain the
following benefits from using Focus:

- You can change your character's position in the Initiative order to
the new value you've rolled, or stay at your original position,
whichever is better for you.

- You can increase your current number of Initiative Points by the
number that you rolled.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* At the start of the combat, you rolled a total of 5 with one
Success Point on your Initiative roll. On the first turn, you decide to
Focus and you get a better roll – a total of 11 with four Success Points
(Initiative Points); you change your position in the Initiative order to
11, and add your one Initiative Point to the four you've just rolled,
for a total five.

You later spend all five of those Initiative Points and in a subsequent
turn, Focus again, getting a total of 9 with three Success Points; your
position in the Initiative order doesn't change, but you do gain three
more Initiative Points to spend. 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Move or Run

Movement allows you to change your position from one Area to another
Area. A normal Move action takes you to an adjacent Area, while a Run
action lets you move through to an Area two away from your starting
position.

**As a Combined Action:** A Move is a Drop 1 penalty, and a Run is a Drop 2
penalty. The most that you can Move in one turn is two Areas, so you
can't do both a Run and a Move at the same time.

#### Prepare

You can use a Prepare action to set up an action to occur after a
specific event happens later in the round. You declare what action your
character will take and what will trigger that action. (You can choose
not to act when the trigger comes up, if circumstances have changed.)

If the end of the round comes and you have not taken the action because
the trigger event hasn't happened, then you can either choose to take
the action at the end of the turn, or forfeit your character's action
for that turn.

If you take any combined actions at the same time as your Prepare
action, you apply the Drop Penalty when you take the prepared action.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Your character gets ready to rush into a room after a friend
opens it, drawing her weapon (Drop 1) in the same turn that you declare
your Prepare action. Your trigger is “when the door opens” and your
character's action will be to move into the room (Drop 1) and attack
someone there. This will have a total Drop 2 penalty due to the combined
actions.

Later you prepare an attack with your sword to trigger “after my friend
disarms our opponent.” This has no extra Drop penalty, since you aren't
moving and your sword is already out. If your opponent doesn't become
disarmed by the end of the round, you can either go ahead and make your
attack, or wait until next round.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


#### Reload

The Reload action lets your character reload one of her firearms. (You
don't have to reload a bow, but you do have to reload a crossbow.) Most
weapons can be reloaded in one round, but it takes a total of 5 uses of
Reload to reload a cannon.

**As a Combined Action:** Reloading a pistol or a crossbow is a Drop 2
penalty. Reloading a musket is a Drop 3 penalty. You can reload two
pistols in one round, since that would be a Drop 4 penalty total, and
Drop 4 is the limit of combined actions you can take in one round.

#### Use a Skill

This is a catch-all category for using a Specialty or Skill in a way
which isn't an attack, either using the Specialty's own Success Tables
or the generic table for Non-Combat Actions in Combat. (See the start of
the Skills document in the playtest packet.)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You decide to use the Deceive specialty to distract your
character's opponent in a fight: “Hey, look, the Guardian's cavaliers
are behind you\!” Normally, Deceive takes one minute to use and doesn't
have a direct combat application, so instead you use the Success Table
for Non-Combat Actions. With your Success Points, you buy increases in
Advantage to represent your successful bluff.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Advantage

Advantage is an abstraction of how well your character is doing in a
fight, expressed as a die value from D6 to D12. Advantage represents a
wide variety of in-fiction states, including your character's relative
positioning in an Area, her general sense of how the fight is going, her
superior stance to her opponent, and even whether or not she is feeling
the rhythm of the fight.

### Increasing Advantage

You begin every combat with no Advantage Die and can increase your
Advantage by spending Success Points, depending upon the Success Table
for an action you've completed. The first time you buy an increase in
Advantage, your Advantage Die goes up to D6; then D8, D10, and D12 with
subsequent (or simultaneous) expenditures of Success Points on
increasing Advantage.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You decide you want your character to make a Feint attack
against her opponent, and you succeed with three Success Points. It's
the start of the fight, so you have no Advantage to begin with, but the
Increase Advantage option on the Feint success table lets you spend one
Success Point for each increase of Advantage. The first point gives you
a D6 Advantage Die, then the following two increase that die size to
D10, spending all three of your Success Points.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Using Advantage

You can include your Advantage die on any attack or defense roll that
you make during combat. Each time you use your Advantage Die, it steps
down one size – from D10 to D8, for example, or from D6 to no Advantage
Die.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You make a Lunge attack and elect to include your Advantage
Die, which currently stands at a D10. You add a D10 to your dice pool
for the attack, and after resolving the Lunge roll, your Advantage Die
drops to a D8.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Other Combat Modifiers

Drop penalties can be applied during a fight based on the fictional
circumstances – for example, if you are on the pitching and rolling deck
of a ship, the MJ can impose a Drop 1 penalty on physical skill checks.

If an area provides cover from attacks, that imposes a Drop 1 or Drop 2
penalty on attacks that fire into that area.

## Damage

There are two types of damage in *The Queen's Cavaliers*: 
**Yield**, which is non-lethal, and
**Wounds**, which bring a character closer to death while imposing penalties
on combat-related actions.

### Yield

Yield is an abstraction representing a character's energy, enthusiasm
for battle, fatigue level, and will to fight.

Each character has a Yield Limit that represents how many points of
Yield she can take until being out of a combat. An NPC who reaches her
Yield Limit will either surrender or be knocked unconscious, at the
option of the MJ. A PC who reaches her Yield Limit can stay in the
fight, but if she does, every attack against her gains the following
addition to its Success Table:

:::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::
|          | (Yielded Out)          |
| :------- | :--------------------- |
| +:       | Inflict 1 Wound        |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Inflict 1 Wound:** Your opponent takes one Wound. If she takes more Wounds
than her Wound Limit (which is four for player characters, and from one
to five for non-player characters), she falls unconscious and is dying.

This even applies to attacks such as Feint or Brawl which can not
normally inflict Wounds. (See the next section for information on
Wounds.)

At the end of a combat, after the combatants have a chance to catch
their breath, all Yield taken is reset to zero – although the effects of
reaching a Yield Limit such as surrender or unconsciousness will
continue (although not the Success Table addition for continuing to
fight past your Yield Limit). Unconscious characters will remain
unconscious for one or more scenes at the MJ's discretion, unless awoken
by others during or after the combat.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You hit with a Lunge attack, with five Success Points. You
decide to spend all five points on Yield, inflicting five Yield on your
opponent. Your opponent has a Yield Limit of four, which means that the
MJ decides you knock her back against a wall and she hits her head,
going unconscious and is out of the fight.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Wounds

A Wound represents a more serious injury than gaining Yield: Wounds
don't heal at the end of the combat, and they inflict Drop Penalties on
characters suffering from them.

Each player character can take four Wounds until being forced out of the
combat, dying. NPCs can take anywhere from one wound (for Rabble) to
five wounds (for Major Characters) – see the Opponents document in the
playtest packet for more information.

In addition, whenever a character takes a Wound, her Yield Limit decreases by one.

The Drop Penalties and Yield Limit changes for each Wound level are shown on the following table:

Table: Drop Penalty from Wounds

| Wounds | Drop Penalty              | Yield Limit |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------|
| None   | Drop 0                    | –           | 
| 1      | Drop 1                    | \-1         |
| 2      | Drop 2                    | \-2         |
| 3      | Drop 4                    | \-3         |
| 4      | Dying (for Wound Limit 4) | \-4         |
| 5      | Dying (for Wound Limit 5) | \-5         |
| 6      | Dying (for Wound Limit 6) | \-6         |

Drop Penalties from Wounds are cumulative with Drop Penalties for combined actions, and apply to the following skills and specialties:

- Defense (all Specialties)
- Dueling (all Specialties)
- Military (Brawl, Aim)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Your character is stabbed by an opponent's Lunge attack and
receives one Wound. You now get a Drop 1 penalty on all applicable
actions, such as attacking or defending. Later in the fight, you are
shot for two more Wounds, which increases your penalty to Drop 4 – one
more Wound and you'll be Dying.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Dying and Death

A Dying character is unconscious for the rest of the combat and cannot take actions.

At the end of the combat, any Dying non-player character dies unless the
player characters make a successful attempt (using the Medicine skill)
to save that NPC – although the MJ can rule that certain NPCs are beyond
saving due to the extent of their injuries.

If a player character is Dying at combat's end, that character's player
can decide to have the character expire – possibly after awakening long
enough to speak some last words to a companion – or receive treatment
through the Medicine skill to keep that character alive.

If the Medicine skill is unsuccessful or the wounds are untreated, the
player can make a Survival Roll using her character's Verve plus her
Competency Die against Moderate Opposition (3D8).


::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
| Survival Roll |                                      | 
| :------------ | :----------------------------------- |
| Pool:         | Verve + Competency Die               | 
| Opposition:   | Standard Opposition – Moderate (3D8) |
| +:            | Survive for 8 Hours                  |
| ++:           | Regain Consciousness                 |
| ++++:         | Heal 1 Wound                         |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Survive for 8 Hours:** The dying character doesn't die of her wounds for
another eight hours per Success Point spent. Make another Survival Roll
at the end of that time period.

**Regain Consciousness:** The dying character is awake and can speak and
react to the world around her, but can't take any actions.

**Heal 1 Wound:** The dying character heals one wound and is no longer
dying.

On a failed Survival Roll, the character dies.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Your character receives a fourth Wound, taking her out of the
fight. At the end of the fight, you can decide if she dies of her
injuries, or fights to survive. If you choose the latter, and there's no
medical aid nearby, you'll need to make a Survival Roll.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Healing Wounds

Unlike Yield, Wounds don't simply go away at the end of a combat. There are two ways to heal Wounds: the Medicine skill, and bed rest.

Resting for two days will heal one Wound. Six days' bed rest is enough to fully heal all Wounds.
