# Magics of Gallinea {.cbreakbefore}

Elara is a world of relatively subtle magicks; there are no balls of fire being flung, no
shapechanging, no glowing swords of light, no necromancers raising the walking dead. Instead, the primary magickal abilities are
reading portents, brewing draughts with alchemy, and weaving charms into clothing.

:# Why Subtle Magicks?

Why did we make the design decision to limit the role of
magicks? Simple: We've found that once you give someone the
ability to throw bolts of lightning at their foes, they don't
really want to fence with rapiers any more.

As *The Queen's Cavaliers* is a swashbuckling game, high-powered magicks don't fit well --
by its very nature, it changes the game to something different. We're not saying that
magick and swordfighting is always a bad match, but we're saying that it doesn't fit
**this** game we've made.

That said, we've run a few experiments in the past with more
magicks than usual. For example, we had alchemically-created vampires,
zombies, and patchwork men; they were created by a mad scientist in a
suit of clockwork powered armor. You're free to experiment as much as
you feel like in your own game, but our recommendation is to keep the
most powerful magicks either off-screen entirely or only in the hands
of very special opponents.

## Witchcraft

The reading of portents is popularly known as *witchcraft*, and originated in pre-Qartan
Gallinea and Ekalia. It involves using any manner of divination tools or methods,
including cards, tea leaves, palmistry, horoscopes, reading natural phenomena, and so on.

The term *witchcraft* is actually a misnomer, as witches have many more practices
than simply reading portents, and portent-reading is practiced by more people than
just witches. However, the average Gallinean's lay misunderstanding of the ancient
Old Faith of the witches has resulted in *witchcraft* becoming the general term for
any kind of magickal prediction of the future.

Witchcraft can be used to do three related things:

  - Answer a yes-or-no question about the future
  - Cast a hex on someone
  - Create a bibelot

### Answering Questions

The basic act of reading portents generally requires that the subject of your portents is
willing -- or yourself. With a successful use of portents, you receive an answer from the
MJ.

Reading portents can create a Tag Die that can be used to influence events toward
making the prediction come true. This expires within 24 hours, or whenever it is used.
If you have more than one specialty rank in Magicks (Portents), you can increase the
duration.

A given person can only have one such prediction in effect on them at a time; further
attempts to do a reading on them don't actually give answers until the first prediction
is either resolved or expires.

::::::::::::::::::::::: toolbox :::::::::::::::::::::
:# Giving Answers

There are three basic approaches you can take when a player
rolls a portents roll. 

  - You decide what seems the most likely answer and you give that answer.
  - You choose the result that best fits your plans for the story.
  - You let the player themselves choose what the answer is.

You don't have to announce which method you're using, either before or after
the roll is made. You don't have to use the same method every time; you can
switch things up.

Here are some examples of each method.

  - The player asks if she can trust the cavalier she met the
    day before. You already know that wasn't actually a cavalier, but
    the notorious spy Martine Deveaux in disguise. You answer "no."
  - The player asks if she'll find a missing ring. You don't know
    for sure if she will, but you figure it would make a fun side
    adventure, so you answer "yes."
  - The player asks if she'll meet the woman of her dreams that night.
    You have no idea, and instead decide to bounce it back to the player.
    "I don't know, what's your answer?" She answers "yes." You make a
    note of this.

Please keep in mind that you aren't obligated to **force** any prediction to come
true -- reading portents is not an exact science but is an art, and there's
always room for intepretation. The Tag Die that can be created with a successful
Magicks (Portents) roll can be used by the player to sway the results, and so
you don't need to do any more than that yourself.

### Casting Hexes

You can throw a hex on someone you dislike. This is sometimes called an *evil eye* ability,
although again that's a misnomer based on misunderstand. Instead, a so-called "hex" works to
manipulate probability to the detriment of the subject.

Each hex is a drop penalty on a given skill and its specialties. For example, you could hex
someone's Defense, and it would apply to Defense (Parry), Defense (Block), and Defense (Dodge)
rolls. The initial penalty is Drop 1, but with higher skill ranks you can increase the
penalty.

Every time the hex penalty is applied to the subject's dice pools, it decreases by one after
the roll. So if you throw a Drop 2 hex on Defense, that gives a Drop 2 penalty on the first
Defense roll made, and a Drop 1 penalty on the second. When a hex reaches Drop 0, it ends; otherwise,
a hex lasts up to 24 hours. As with asking questions, a skilled practitioner of witchcraft can
increase this duration.

### Creating Bibelots

A bibelot is a type of charm that provides protection against hexes and against bad luck.
These are created with the Magicks (Portents) specialty<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection">Crafting</a>.
Bibelots are often crafted from glass, copper, pottery, carved gems, or leaves.

You use a bibelot by wearing it on your person, in contact with your skin, although it doesn't need to
be openly displayed. You can only wear one bibelot at a time; touching a second bibelot with your bare
skin causes the first one to shatter. You can carry additional bibelots as long as you don't touch them;
for example, in a pocket or belt pouch. For a list of bibelots, see <a href="#bibelots" class="xref-inchapter-under">Bibelots</a>.

## Alchemy 

Alchemy was codified during the days of the Qartan Empire, although the general principles had been known for
centuries before. Each salve, poultice, or draught is brewed according to a specific recipe, using the 
Magicks (Brew) specialty<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>. 
Ingredients are chosen more for their symbolic essence than any actual medical
benefit; this is why alchemy is magick and not science.

Alchemical supplies are used to create alchemical items; once created, an item can be used by anyone.

Most Alchemy items bestow a Charm die upon the recipient. As you can only include one Charm
Die in any dice pool, this means that you can't get the benefit of both charmwoven apparel
and a draught or salve in the same dice pool.

### Draughts 

Draughts are used by drinking them, although a draught can also be given to a willing, yielded-out,
unconscious, or dying character as a Drop 4 combined action.

Forcing a draught down someone's throat requires that a hold be made with Brawl, and then 
four success points can be used to make them drink the draught.

### Salves

Salves, balms, unguents, oils, unctions, and lotions are applied externally, usually to the hands or face.
Applying one to a willing, yielded-out, unconscious, or dying character is a Drop 4 combined action.

## Charmweaving

Charmweaving was invented in Lutetia in just the last century. New developments in weaving and fashion
blended together to create apparel with magickal charms that improve the wearer's ability with a
designated specialty.

Most nobles in Gallinea, and many people of other social ranks, will
purchase and wear charmwoven clothing. Charmweavers who inspect an article
of clothing may be able to discern which specialty is enhanced by a given
piece of attire.

### The Nine Laws of Fashion

Charmwoven clothes are useful, stylish, and expensive, but they are also
made according to exacting standards known as Gallinea's Nine Laws of
Fashion. Flouting these laws could lead to your Charms simply failing to
work at all!

While these are known as "Gallinea's" Laws, that's not because they're
enforced by the Queen's decree or by some sort of "fashion police" that
stalks the streets of Lutetia. Instead, these are akin to natural Laws
that were first noticed and codified in Gallinea; they simply describe
how things are rather than how they should be.

  - The Law of Couture: "One's clothes must fit properly."
  - The Law of Attunement: "Charms are unique to the wearer."
  - The Law of Pertinence: "The charm must correspond to the article."
  - The Law of Dissonance: "Dissonance limits the effectiveness of charms."
  - The Law of Cacophony: "Unrestrained use of color creates dissonance."
  - The Law of Neutrality: "Neutral colors do not generate dissonance."
  - The Law of Darning: "Rips, tears, and holes produce dissonance."
  - The Law of Station: "Outfits of mismatched attire produce dissonance."
  - The Law of *Dernier Cri*: "Dated fashions generate dissonance."
