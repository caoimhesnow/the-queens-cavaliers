# Gallinean Holidays ## {.cbreakbefore}

Gallineans love holidays. After all, what is a holiday if not an
excuse to throw a party?

Any employed person of Artisan (D8) social rank or higher is not expected to
work on a holiday. Conversely, anyone of Commoner (D0) rank with a job is
absolutely expected to work on a holiday. Only rare situations are commoners
given a day off from work.

## Asrian Holy Days

The sixth day of every month is the first Sun Day of that month, and is
when most Asrian holy days celebrate the sun goddess Eserre. Devout
Gallineans are expected to attend church on those days, even if they
don't manage to make it to services on any other Sun Day in a month.

### Winter Holy Days

6 Nivôse is celebrated as Winter's Dawn, and is considered the official
start of the winter season. Services in the Asrian churches ask for the
blessings of the Goddess-Empress Eserre upon the faithful, and ask for a
gentle winter.

The current date for a new campaign start is presumed to be 1 Messidor 1249 PQ unless otherwise specified by the MJ.

The winter solstice occurs on 6 Pluviôse, marking the midpoint of winter
and the time in which Eserre's sun is out for the least amount of time.
Gallineans mark this date, and the two days around it, with the Winter's
Noon Festival – a time to come together and share warmth, food, and
stories, in addition to religious services.

The 6th of Ventôse is the third holy day of winter in the Asrian faith,
and is known as Winter's Dusk. Heading out of the coldest part of the
year toward the spring thaw, the Chaplains of Eserre ask for a
prosperous growing season. Tradition says that if a sun jay sees its
shadow at noon on Winter's Dusk, winter weather will continue into
Germinal, the next month. The Chaplains in Lutetia raise sun jays
specifically for this purpose.

### Spring Holy Days

Spring's Dawn, on 6 Germinal, is a day of thanks for the end of winter
and start of spring, with churches and worshipers alike decorated with
flowers. The 6th of Floréal is Spring's Noon, the vernal equinox, and is
marked by outdoor festivals and dances around spring poles. Spring's
Dusk on 6 Prairial is holy day of peace, when even the most brutal of
Elara's armies will refrain from war.

Confirmation Day, 18 Prairial, commemorates the mythological wedding of
Eserre to her beloved Safira, the first Bride of the Sun. On this day
each year, young teenagers publicly present themselves as faithful
followers of the Sun Goddess and are henceforth considered as adults by
the Church.

### Summer Holy Days

On 6 Messidor, Summer's Dawn, the Asrian high holy months officially
begin, lasting until Summer's Dusk, 6 Fructidor. The legends of Eserre
and the Qartan Empire are read or re-enacted over the course of eight
consecutive Sun Days, save for 6 Fervidor, the holiest day of the year.
On that longest day of the year, and the days before and after it, known
as Summer's Noon, the most lavish celebrations are held under the midday
sun. The most non-pious Gallineans will make a point to attend these
midsummer services, even if they will never enter a church or cathedral
the rest of the year.

### Fall Holy Days

The fall holy days of Autumn's Dawn (6 Vendémiaire), Autumn's Noon (6
Brumaire), and Autumn's Dusk (6 Frimaire) are quieter affairs, devoted
to teaching, sermons, and service as the year winds down, the crops are
harvested, and the worshipers of the Sun Goddess prepare for winter.

## New Moon Festivals

In addition to Asrian religious holy days, Gallineans also celebrate
ancient traditions associated with the Old Faith of the witches. These
folk holidays occur on new moons, in the evening when the sky is dark.
Most involve sharing of gifts and meals with family and close friends.

The New Hunger Moon, 16 Nivôse, is a time for giving food to those in
need in the chill of winter. 16 Pluviôse, the New Wolf Moon, is marked
by the exchange of furs and warm clothing. New Snow Moon, on 16 Ventôse,
is a celebration marked by wine and other types of alcohol that have
been saved in the snow all winter.

The New Sap Moon, on 16 Germinal, celebrates the start of spring with
traditional meals of maple syrups served on crêpes. 16 Floréal is the
New Rain Moon, and gifts of boots and jackets are common as the spring
rains begin. On 16 Prairial, the New Wishing Moon is celebrated with
exchanges of lucky trinkets and wishes kept in secret.

The 16th of Messidor, the New Berry Moon, marks the beginning of summer
with sweet pies, tarts, and pastries. The New Kissing Moon, on 16
Fervidor, is a night for lovers to spend in each others' arms under the
stars, and is said to be the reason that there are more births than
normal in Floréal nine months later. The final folk celebration of the
summer, New Peddler's Moon, is celebrated through the exchange of
hand-made gifts given as part of a mock barter system.

The first of the fall festivals, the New Harvest Moon on 16 Vendémiaire,
is a night of bonfires, music, and dancing. The New Huntress Moon, 16
Brumaire, is marked by large dinners of game meats such as venison,
rabbit, or pheasant. On the night of 16 Frimaire, the New Mourning Moon,
Gallineans remember their dead friends and relatives, especially those
who have passed within the last year, through guising or mumming.

## Devran Holy Days

The Devrans have their own holy days when the moon is a crescent in the
sky. The 13th of each month is known as Last Crescent, and the 19th of
each month is the First Crescent. Ceremonies are held on both nights,
and many Devrans fast nightly during the week between the two holy days.

## National Holidays

Gallinea's national holidays are secular in nature and recognize
important events in the history of the queendom.

Treaty Day, also known as Betrothal Day, is the anniversary of the
signing of the Treaty of Scanbreille on 21 Nivôse 1241 – ending the war
between Albia and Gallinea through the later marriage of Prince Carolus
to Princess Mariana, the future Queen Mariana II. The 16th day of
Floréal, also called Espousal Day, is the anniversary of the wedding of
Carolus and Mariana in 1242.

Scanbrian Unification Day, 15 Pluviôse, commemorates the date in 989
when Scanbria became unified with Gallinea. Scanbrians also celebrate 30
Fructidor, Scanbrian Independence Day, which marks the date in 986 when
Scanbria declared its independence from Varendia. Many older Scanbrian
families still resent that the Grand Duchy of Scanbria lasted for only
three years before being annexed by the Gallineans, and the day is
usually one for political agitation. Needless to say, Scanbrian
Independence Day is not celebrated in the rest of Gallinea.

Victory Day, on 7 Prairial, marks the defeat of Varendia in 1123 by
future princess-consort Clarisse Sudelune, also known as La Dame de la
Victoire. The day is celebrated by military parades along the Rue du
Couer, both in Lutetia and elsewhere in Gallinea.

The Festival of Masques is held on 24 Prairial every year, and is an
annual celebration of freedom in Lutetia centered around lavish
masquerade balls, street parties, and excessive drinking. Anyone caught
outside of their home without a disguise is "arrested" and taken to the
nearest constable, who forces them to wear a cheap and embarrassing
costume. The Festival of Masques is also a time for much intrigue and
illicit affairs, as no one is whom they seem to be.

One of the largest civic holidays is the birthday of the queen. As the
current queen, Mariana's birth is celebrated every 19 Fructidor. The
birthday of her mother, the late Queen Elisse II, used to be celebrated
on 21 Floréal but is no longer an official holiday. Some members of the
nobility, who strongly opposed Elisse's policies when she lived,
celebrate only her birthday to insult the current queen.

The deaths of Queen Elisse and her daughter, crown princess Jehanne, are
remembered by solemn ceremonies on 22 Frimaire, as they have been every
year since that dark day in 1243.

30 Nivôse and 1 Pluviôse, the end of one year and the start of the next,
are secular holidays celebrated as Year's Dusk and Year's Dawn. These
are usually quiet days of reflection on the events of the previous
twelve months and a time to make plans for the upcoming year.
