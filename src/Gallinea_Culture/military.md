# The Gallinean Military {.cbreakbefore}

Elara is rarely a peaceful continent. At any given time, there
are likely border disputes and minor provocations, even if a state
of war doesn't exist between any two given countries.

Located in the middle of Elara, Gallinea has been at war with every
one of its neighbors at one time or another, as well as with Talania
and Dragosa in centuries past. Perhaps only two times out of five was
the conflict initiated by the other country.

At the present time, Gallinea is at peace with its neighbors, having
concluded the Twenty Years' War against Albia just 8 years back. As a
result of that war, there are a number of veterans in Gallinea, many
of whom remain in military to this day.


## The Queen's Armies

The Gallinean military is, collectively referred to as "The Queen's Armies". There are
a total of nine distinct divisions within the Queen's Armies, as shown on the following
table.

Table: The Queen's Armies

| Number | Name                        | Duties                                   |
| :----: | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| 1st    | Armée du Coeur              | Defense of Lutetia and Coeur de Gallinea |
| 2nd    | Armée des Bijoux            | Defense of eastern and southern Gallinea |
| 3rd    | Armée de L'ouest            | Defense of western Gallinea              |
| 4th    | Armée du Nord               | Defense of the northern border           |
| 5th    | Armée des Mers              | The Gallinean royal navy                 |
| 6th    | Armée Coloniale             | Defense of the Elissian colony in Ifran  |
| 7th    | Armée des Cieux             | Her majesty's sky navy                   |
|        | Garde d'élite Royale        | The queen's elite guard                  |
|        | Queen's Cavaliers           | Ceremonial champions of the queen        |

The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 6th armies are led by a senior *général*, while the 5th and
7th are navies, and are led by a senior *amiral*. Commandants head both the elite guard
and the cavaliers, with a rank equal to a *colonel* or *vice-amiral*.

## Military Ranks in Gallinea

The following ranks are used in the Queen's Armies to designate
military rank. A Lieutenant or higher is considered to be an officer.

The ranks of *Maréchal* and *Cavalier Commandant* are singular positions,
only held by one person at a time, although individuals who previously
held such a position is traditionally referred to by that rank for the
rest of their lives.

Table: Comparative Military Ranks

| Army Rank             | Naval Rank      | Cavalier Rank       | 
| :-------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------ |
| Maréchal de Gallinea  | --              | --                  |
| Général               | Amiral          | *Prince-Consort*    |
| Colonel               | Vice-Amiral     | Cavalier Commandant |
| Major                 | Capitaine-Major | Cavalier Capitaine  |
| Capitaine             | Capitaine       | Cavalier Lieutenant |
| Lieutenant            | Lieutenant      | Cavalier            |
| Sergent               | Major           | --                  |
| Caporal               | Maître          | --                  |
| Soldat                | Matelot         | Cavalier Recruit    |

### Conscription in Wartime

During the war with Albia, Gallinea instituted a draft as it in previous centuries. All
able-bodied adults were expected to present themselves to the capital of their provinces,
although nobles were automatically excused from service, as well as artisans who could
contribute to the war effort. Members of the Queen's Cavaliers were also granted a leave
from the draft, although most ended up joining one of the regular armies anyway.

The majority of the conscripts went to the 3rd, 4th, and 5th armies. The 7th was
created from the 5th as Gallinea added armed airships to its military forces. It's
still a point of anger among many veterans the 3rd, 4th, and 5th
that the majority of the deaths during the Twenty Years' War were from those three
armies, while the 1st and 2nd had relatively few casualties.

## The Royal Navy

While *Armée des Mers* remains the official name of the 5th army, nearly everyone 
calls it the Gallinean Royal Navy. Its rank titles were adapted from those used in 
the Ondalan navy in the 11th century to differentiate naval officers from infantry
and cavalry.

The Royal Navy has sailing ships from the smallest size to the largest, and also maintains
lighthouses along each coast of Gallinea. Most ships also carry a contigent of Royal
Marines, specially trained for hand-to-hand combat on ships and landings.

### Her Majesty's Sky Navy

The first military airship was a converted sea-going vessel, the *Valerius*, which
underwent its refit in 1219, two years before the start of Twenty Years' War. Although
it didn't survive past the fifth year of the war, it was followed by a total of 22 more
airships in Her Majesty's Sky Navy. Of those, 7 were destroyed in the war, 2 were 
converted back to sea vessels, and 1 was decommissioned to serve as the Royal Yacht.
The following table lists the current fleet of 12 sky navy airships.

Table: Her Majesty's Sky Navy

| Airship Name     | Size                |
| :--------------- | :------------------ |
| **Amarante**     | Cloud Brigantine    |
| **Aubene**       | Cloud Brigantine    |
| **Audace**       | Sky Galion          |
| **Galaxie**      | Star Fregate        |
| **Intrépide**    | Sky Galion          |
| **Jérôme**       | Cloud Brigantine    |
| **Lutetia**      | Star Fregate        |
| **Persolei**     | Star Fregate        |
| **Pégase**       | Dame des Cieux      |
| **République**   | Sky Galion          |
| **Résistance**   | Sky Galion          |
| **Vaillante**    | Sky Galion          |

Cloud brigantines are the smallest of the military airships, followed by star fregates and
sky galions. The largest ship in the Gallinean sky navy is the massive Pégase, one of only
two Dames des Cieux ever built.

## Garde d'élite Royale

The queen's elite guard have one duty and one duty only -- maintaining the safety of the
current monarch. Handpicked from the best officers in the regular armies, they are fierce
in their sworn duty and will die for their Queen.

Few members of the elite guard have served in it longer than six years. The guard's failure
to protect Queen Elisse was a horrific stain on the honor of the guard, and of those who
did not resign, most were purged in the months following the queen's assassination.

## The Queen's Cavaliers

At one time, the cavaliers were an elite cavalry branch of the military. Over the years,
the cavaliers were less of a military unit and more a ceremonial honor bestowed upon those
who performed a service for the monarch. Later still, there were no expectations of 
duty; 100 years ago, the cavaliers were effectively a social club for aging officers and
lower-ranking nobles.

The reformation of the Cavaliers began under Queen Amarante, the grandmother of the current
queen, transforming the organization from a club back to a fighting force to champion the
queen's interests, although one without a military style of command. Instead, members of the
Cavaliers are loosely organized with a simple hierarchy and an expectation that they will
represent the interests of the Queen and the Country.

All Cavaliers, save those who are new recruits, are considered to be the equivalent of 
officers in the Queen's Army -- at least, on paper. In truth, few in the regular army recognize
"cavalier" as a rank, and actual salutes are hardly ever given to a cavalier. Any cavalier who
tries to pull rank will find themselves roundly mocked, at best.
