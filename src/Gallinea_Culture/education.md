# Education in Gallinea {.breakbefore}

Nearly all Gallineans are educated enough to read and write, especially in the larger
cities. Literacy rates are lower but still high in rural areas.

## Childhood Education

From the time a child is able to talk, she or he is given instruction in the Gallinean
language by their family members. Upon reaching 5 years of age, a child can be enrolled
in one of the church-run schools, usually for one or two days per six-day week, although
never on a Sun Day.

When older children reach the age of 10, they are usually enrolled full-time in a school
of some kind. Gallinea operates state academies in every city, although those who can
afford to send their children to private acadamies usually do so. Most schools are 
residential schools, where the students live at the school, although some of the state
academies only provide housing for students whose families don't reside in the same city
as the academy.

At the age of 16, a Gallinean child is expected to decide what kind of career choice to
pursue. The most common choices are apprenticeship, enlistment in the Queen's Army, 
attenting a *Grande École*, or doing physical labor such as working on a farm with one's
family or neighbors.

## Apprenticeship

The oldest method of training, and still the most common, is apprenticeship to a senior
member of a trade. This is how most artisans learn their craft, including alchemists,
charmweavers, mechanicians, and weaponsmiths. Most apprenticeships last one to six
years, with the first year being paid for by the apprentice or her family. In subsequent
years, the apprentice usually more than makes up for the cost of her training in the form 
of extra busywork that she does for her master.

## Enlistment

Gallineans who choose to enlist in the Queen's Army are given six months of training and
preparation before being assigned to active duty for a period of two years. The training
time can be shortened to as little as one month during wartime, and the term of duty
extended to four years or more.

Those who show the most promise during the post-enlistment training may be recommended
for *l'Académie d'Officiers Militaires*, to be trained as officers. Likewise, those
best suited for technical jobs such as powdersmiths or mechanicians are given additional 
training of up to a year.

## The Universities of Lutetia

To the average Lutetian, when one speaks of *Grandes Écoles*, that refers exclusively to 
Les Universités Royales de Lutetia, commonly known as the Universities of Lutetia.
There are three adjacent schools that comprise *Les Universités Royales*, located in the
northeast of Lutetia: The Royal Gallinean Academy of Sciences, The University of Letters and Arts,
and Lutetia College of History.

Study at the Academy of Sciences usually takes three years, and results in a 
*licentia des sciences*. Two years' additional study can earn a *maîtresse des sciences*, and
three more years a *doctorat en sciences*. Specific fields taught include chemistry, mathematics,
zoology, botany, medicine, and engineering.

The University of Letters and Arts bestows a *licentia des arts* after two years of study, a
*maîtresse des arts* after an additional two, and a *doctorat en arts* after a year more.
Fields of study include music, literature, painting, sculpture, theatrics, and poetry.

The College of History grants *licentia de l'histoire* after three years, *maîtresse de l'histoire* 
after a total of five years, and a *doctorat en histoire* after a eight years study. Specific
topics include law, philosophy, archaeology, religion, and political science.

## Académie de Valerienne

The residents of Valerienne, on the other hand, hold that the Académie de Valerienne is the
superior institution to the Lutetian universities. They offer roughly the same degrees
as Lutetia, although they also offer a *licentia des magicks*, *maîtresse des magicks*,
and *doctorat en magicks* in the field of alchemy.

## Scanbreille University

Located in Scanbria, Scanbreille University can bestow degrees in sciences, arts, and history,
including specializations in military studies and linguistics. They also offer *licentia des magicks*
and *maîtresse des magicks* in charmweaving, although not a *doctorat*.

## l'Académie d'Officiers Militaires

Members of the Queen's Army selected for training as officers undergo training at l'Académie 
d'Officiers Militaires, known simply as l'Académie among Lutetians and officers alike. Education 
at l'Académie takes one year and awards a *licentia d'officier* as well as a commission as a
lieutenant. Further study for an additional three years grants a *maître des armées*, 
 required for teaching at l'Académie and for promotion to the highest ranks, Général or Amiral.

## Le Nouveau École de Persolei

The newest of the *Grandes Écoles*, was established just 15 years ago in Persolei. It has a
reputation as an upstart offering non-traditional education, and many older academics look down
their noses at a graduate of Le Nouveau. They offer *licentia des sciences* and *maîtresse des sciences*
in astronomy, alchemy, and mining; *licentia des arts* and *maîtresse des arts* in 
chorale, theatrics and dance; and *licentia de l'histoire* and *maîtresse de l'histoire* in 
comparative theology, criminal defense barristry, critical thinking, and cultural studies.

## Theological Seminary of Cordova

All chaplains are required to study at the Theological Seminary in Cordova, Ondala, or study directly
under a seminary-educated theologian. A basic education takes three years and grants a 
*licentia de religion* as well as ordination as a chaplain. An additional three years of study is
required to earn a *maîtresse de religion* which qualifies one to both teach other chaplains abroad and
serve as senior chaplain. A full *doctorat en religion* is required for arch-chaplains and also for
teaching at the theological seminary.

Chaplains who are ordained without the requisite training are expected to report to Cordova as soon
as they able to able to do so. The current matriarch of the church, Isabene de la Justicia, was ordinained
as a chaplain before attenting the seminary; to many of the more conservative arch-chaplains, this was
enough to later disqualify her from ascension as the Bride of the Sun.

## Private Tutoring

Most nobles' children don't attend school, even the elite schools favored by the daughters and sons of
grandmaster artisans, and are instead tutored by those with advanced degrees.
A minimum of a *maîtresse* is required by most nobles, and they tend to prefer those with *doctorats*.
Two to five years of tutoring after age 15 can lead to the equivalent of a *licencia*; such a student
is required to submit themselves for examination by a panel at one of the *Grandes Écoles*. Any further
education would need to be done through that school as a regular student; however, the majority of 
nobles don't get higher than a *licencia* unless they wish to become academics themselves.
