# Government of Gallinea {.breakbefore}

As a nation, Gallinea is a hetereditary monarchy, with ultimate power vested
in the Queen (or, in rare cases, the King if the monarch is male).

However, the Queen's power has been delegated to specific individuals and
groups in recent years, leading to a dillution of royal power. While any Queen
could retake that power, it would prove vastly unpopular and could lead to
civil war.

The Queen's ministers, the Parliament of Nobles, the Assembly of Guilds, and the
Convocation of Veterans all share a measure of power that dperives from the
Pegasus Throne.

## The Queen and Royal Family

:# "The Queen's Consent or Assent"

For a proposal of any kind to become a law, it must be written down and conveyed
in writing to the Queen. In theory, any resident of Gallinea can send a proposal
to the Queen, but in practice, they originate with one of the royal ministries,
the Parliament of Nobles, the Assembly of Guilds, or the Convocation of Veterans.

The Queen can take one of three possible responses:

   - **Assent:** If the Queen personally approves of a proposal, she
     can, with whatever editing she wishes, issue the proposal as a royal
     proclamation.

   - **Denial:** If the Queen disapproves of a proposal, she can reject it.
     A rejected proposal is sent back to the originator.

   - **Consent:** If the Queen doesn't respond within 30 days to a proposal 
     submitted by the Parliament, the Assembly, the Convocation, or a royal
     ministry, it assumed that she has no objections and the proposal becomes
     law of the land.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The Queen rules Gallinea. No laws can go into effect without her consent or assent.
She has the power to overturn any precedent set by her predecessors, although most
monarchs have been reluctant to do so. The Queen appoints the ministers of the
court, the ambassadors to foreign countries, the Maréchal de Gallinea, the lady-governor
of Elissia, and the lady-mayor of Lutetia.

In addition, the Queen approves all treaties with foreign powers, can pardon any
crime committed on Gallinean soil, declares war upon Gallinea's enemies, 
and authorizes the minting of Gallinean coin.

The people of Gallinea generally love their monarch, and she loves them; most Queens'
relationships with the nobility have been contentious. 

The primary expectation that Gallinea has on its queen is this: to produce an heir.
Lack of a clear successor has plunged Gallinea into bloody civil twice throughout
its history, and the stable continuity provided by a royal line is considered well
worth any drawbacks of the monarchy.r

The current Queen, Mariana II, and her husband Prince-Consort Carolus, have yet to
produce children. This is a worrisome situation with many in courtly and noble
circles, especially after the brutal murder of the previous queen and the crown
princess. Rumors blame everything from a ghost's curse to Carolus's status as the
youngest son of the Albian king. Only time will tell if the war-ending arranged
marriage will produce an heir to the throne.

Upon the death of a monarch, her eldest daughter becomes Queen. The throne never passes
to the princess-consort; Gallinea is not a wedding gift. If there is no daughter, a
King will take the throne, as has happened only three times in Gallinean history.

If the late queen had no children at all, then the throne passes to her next younger
sister or, if lacking sisters, to the oldest brother. And if there are no siblings? The
succession moves up a generation, to the previous queen's oldest sister, or her daughters,
if there are any.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Were something to -- *Eserre forfend!* -- happen to Queen Mariana, the next monarch of
Gallinea would be chosen as follows:

   - Does she have a daughter? Not currently. Continue on.
   - Does she have a son? Not currently. Continue on.
   - Does she have a younger sister? No, continue on.
   - Does she have a brother? No, continue on.
   - Does her mother have a younger sister? Yes! She does! Princess Dyann is the younger sister of Mariana's mother, Queen Elisse.
   - Does Dyann have an oldest daughter? Yes! Princess Amarante is the 17-year-old daughter of Dyann and the cousin of Mariana.

Therefore, Amarante would be the successor if Mariana died.

If the new Queen is not considered adult -- which means 16 years or older -- then a regent is appointed.
Traditionally, this is the spouse of the previous queen, the parent of the new queen, or another trusted 
member of the royal family.

The current order of succession for the Gallinean throne is shown in the following table.

Table: Order of Succession

| Place | Name         | Current Title  | Relationship to Mariana                             |
| :---: | :----------- | :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Amarante     | Crown Princess | Cousin                                              |
| 2     | Clarisse     | Princess       | Cousin; sister of Aramante                          |
| 3     | Philippe     | Prince         | Cousin; brother of Aramante                         |
| 4     | Dyann        | Princess       | Aunt; sister of Elisse                              |
| 5     | Jehan        | Prince         | Cousin; son of Jean-Remy                            |
| 6     | Jean-Remy    | Prince         | Uncle; brother of Elisse                            |
| 7+    |              | Prince(ss)     | Distant cousins; grandchildren of Queen Amarante II |

One pecularity exists: Jean-Remy is actually older than Dyann, and was born Princess
Renee. His transition to male moved him down the order of succession from 2nd to
6th. As far as is known, Jean-Remy has only one child, his 5-year-old son, Jehan.

## Ministers of the Court

Each minister of the court is assigned a specific portfolio and is the Queen's primary advisor
on topics related that portfolia. Ministers are appointed by the Queen and serve at her pleasure;
she can fire a minister at any time, although this is a rare occurence. 

In addition to advisory duties, each minister heads a branch of the Gallinean government bureaucracy,
according to their portfolio. For example, the Minister of Justice leads the Ministry of Justice.

Unlike her mother, Mariana has been conservative in her choices, maintaining most of Elisse's ministers
in lieu of choosing her own. 

The current ministers of the court are shown in the following table.

## The Parliament of Nobles

Each province associated with a noble title has one seat on the Parliament of Nobles, one
of the three deliberative bodies in Gallinea. In most cases, the member of Parliament is also
the reigning noble of the province, although it's not unknown to send a proxy to Parliament. Such
proxies must themselves be nobles.

The Parliament of Nobles has four powers:

   - They vote to recognize a baronetess rank bestowed by the queen.
   - They can propose new laws related to noble titles and taxes on noble estates. Such
     proposals become laws only with the Queen's consent or assent.
   - They serve as the trial court when any member of the nobility is accused of a crime.
   - They can hold non-binding votes which are delivered as letters to the Queen, advising
     her of specific actions to take or avoid.

## The Assembly of Guilds

There are a total of 84 guilds recognized in Gallinea, from the powerful Machinists' Guild to
the oft-overlooked Union of Xylographers. Each guild with a royal charter is entitled to one
seat at the Assembly, although the voting power of each seat varies based on the number of members
in that guild.

The Assembly of Guilds is delegated the following authority:

   - They set tariffs on goods from outside Gallinea.
   - They can approve the creation of new guilds.
   - They determine the amount of taxes to be paid by each artisan in Gallinea.
   - They draft the standards for each profession on what is required to be considered
     a master within that craft. Usually these standards are assigned to a subcommittee
     of the Assembly with a stake in the relevant occupation.

## The Convocation of Veterans

The newest of the three deliberative bodies in Gallinean government, the Convocation of
Veterans was created only 150 years ago. The purpose is to allow those who have served
Gallinea in battle to have a voice in the government.

Each regiment in the Queen's Armies is allowed to send two veterans to the Convocation,
selected by those who have served in that regiment. (In the Queen's Navy, the regiments
referred to as "fleets.") One veteran is chosen by the former enlisted soldiers in the
regiment, and one is chosen by the former officers.

The 3rd, 4th, and 6th armies each have 7 regiments. The 1st has 4 regiments, and the
2nd has 6. There are 5 fleets in the navy, and 1 fleet in the sky navy. This brings the
total membership of the Convocation to 74. 

The powers of the Convocation are:

   - They organize and institute a conscription program during times of war.
   - They approve the dress and insignia of new military units.
   - They can propose spending related to military strength, such as weapons,
     armor, or ships.
   - They can bestow military honors on veterans, including posthumously.
