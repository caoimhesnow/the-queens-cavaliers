# Crime and Punishment {.cbreakbefore}

Crime in Gallinea isn't exactly rampant, but it's not unknown either.
Especially during times of chaotic upheaval or great need, people
will turn to stealing from their neighbors. In even more serious
cases, passions may overwhelm someone to the point that they cause
injury or death to another.

When such things occur, the criminals must be caught and society's
punishments inflicted.

## Asrian Principles of Justice

The foundation of the Gallinean legal system was laid in the Qartan
Empire, and is based on the Nine Precepts of the Asrian faith.

The fourth, fifth, and sixth precepts -- known collectively as the
Three Directives -- speak most directly to issues of justice, while
the seventh, eighth, and nine precepts= -- the Three Prohibitions --
put limits on how individual Asrians as well as an Asrian-based state
are allowed to act.

The Fourth Precept invites worshipers to "freely partake of only that
which is has been given to you," and is applied not only in cases of
literal theft but also other crimes of personal violation. The Fifth
Precept says that kindness should be repaid three times and harm only
once, which is taken as a directive to have the punishment fit the crime.
And the Sixth Precept is the basis for the existence of court trials,
with or without a jury -- since the truth will "endure forever, while
falsehoods wither."

The Seventh Precept is used to guarantee equality under the law, whether
those on trial are women or men. The Eighth is a broad prohibition against
slavery, as well as against excess usury, kidnapping, and restrictions on
divorce. The Ninth, "let no one kill except to sustain life," classifies
an execution as the highest possible punishment and restricts its use in
most cases.

## The Queen's Law

While based on Asrian precepts, the Gallinean legal system ultimately
has the Queen at the center. All laws must have the support or assent
of the Queen to take effect.

The laws and rulings issued by previous Queens are binding precedents on
the current Queen; they must be directly and explicitly declared null and
void before a sitting Queen can ignore them. 

This is not a decision taken lightly by a queen. 
Before the reign Queen Elisse III, the late mother of the current Queen,
the average monarch only nullified an average of five of her predecessors'
rulings during their reigns. 
Elisse, called the Reformer by some and the Mad Despot by others, nullified
a total of 22 precedents in her 20 years on the Pegasus Throne. Queen
Mariana II, her daughter and successor, has thus far not voided any
precedents.


## City Watch

The city watch started as a simple part time militia, and in many smaller towns remains
just that. But in any city of decent size, being a member of the city watch is a full-time job.

Watch members are authorized to arrest anyone who they see actively committing a crime. They
can also disperse crowds and the identities of suspicious individuals. During a
natural disaster or time of active warfare in a city, they can direct anyone up to Artisan social
rank to join in relief or defense efforts. The prisons of Gallinea are usually staffed
by the nearest city watch, although there are two that are run directly by the Queen's
Army.

The city watch is limited in the following ways:

   - they can't arrest Nobility or Royalty
   - they can only arrest people who they see committing a crime
   - they don't investigate crimes
   - they can't take someone's weapons unless they are arresting that person for a crime

In many larger cities, including Lutetia, certain members of the city watch are notorious for
being willing to take bribes. These are usually a small percent of the watch, but the code of
siblinghood among watch members prevents the more honest guards from turning in their 
corrupt colleagues.

## Constables

The role of the constables is to investigate crimes that have occured, and prevent future crimes 
from happening. They usually work hand-in-hand with the city watch, although constables have 
more specialized training and are treated as equal to officer-rank watch members.

Constables are expected to gather as many of the facts as possible and present them to the crown
barristers for prosecution. Any constable who falsifies or even holds back evidence is
considered to be abusing their authority and can themselves by charged by a crown barrister
for doing so.

All active duty constables are authorized by the crown and ultimately report to Gallinea's
minister of justice. This means that they have authority recognized in all Gallinean provinces
and territories, including the colony of Elissia. There is no "lack of jurisdiction" for a serving
constable. In addition, constables are authorized, unlike the city watch, to arrest anyone in
Gallinea up to and including nobility and members of the Queen's family. The only person they
cannot legally arrest is the Queen -- crimes in Gallinea are considered crimes against the
crown, and the wearer of the crown cannot legally commit a crime against herself.

Retired constables often become independent investigators, doing work for nobles, other private
parties, or defense barristers.

## Barristers

The legal profession in Gallinea is practiced by barristers, who must have an advanced 
*maîtresse de l'histoire* degree in law and pass an examination administered by the 
ministry of justice. 

There are three main types of barristers:

   - **Crown Barristers** represent the Queen and are responsible for making the case
     for a guilty verdict in a criminal case. If the crown can't prove guilt, then the
     charges are considered dismissed.

   - **Defense Barristers** argue against the guilt of those accused of crime. Until
     recently, all defense barristers were privately employed; one of the Elissian
     Reforms mandated that those without the ability to afford a defense barrister would
     be assigned one at the crown's expense. Such appointed defense barristers are
     expected to work independent of the crown, as they are presenting arguments in
     direct conflict with the crown barristers.

   - **Private Barristers** are those which argue in civil cases where the crown does
     not have an interest. For example, if one mechanician wishes to sue another for
     theft of their schematics, and the crown barristers have not chosen to pursue a
     criminal case, the mechanician can hire a private barrister to plead the case.

## Judges

All court hearings are overseen by three judges to prevent corruption. The judges are
ranked by seniority, with the most senior judge serving as the chairperson of the panel
and leading the hearing. The second most senior judge is assigned the task of coordinating
the evidence, including the calling of witnesses. The least senior judge is assigned to
produce the official proceedings of the court and, if there is a jury, to interact with
requests from the jury.

Each province in Gallinea has at least one panel of judges. A barony -- the smallest
type of province -- usually has just the one panel. Viscounties and counties usually have
two or three panels, and marquessates have four to six. Every duchy has nine panels of
judges and Lutetia has twelve panels. All told, Gallinea has a total of 131 such panels,
for a total of 393 judges.

Similar to barristers, judges must have a *maîtresse de l'histoire* degree. A judge is
appointed by the crown with advisement by the ministry of justice and serves for a
term of nine years. At the end of this term, a judge can be reappointed once to the same
panel, or can be appointed to a different panel within the queendom.

## Juries

Anyone of at least Soldier (D6) social rank has the right to request a trial by a jury
of their peers. Members of the Queen's Army who are actively serving will be tried in a 
court-martial by other soldiers, and others of the same social rank will be tried by a
jury of veterans.

If the accused is of Artisan (D8) social rank, the jury is selected from members of the
artisan guilds. Members of the Nobility (D10) social rank who are accused of crimes are 
only ever tried before the whole Parliament of Nobles.

Under Gallinean law, those of Commoner (D0) social rank don't have a right to a jury trial.
However, common practice is to allow them to request such a trial, and if the judges and
crown barristers consent, a jury of commoners will be created.

Judges have the ability to order anyone within their province, short of a member of the
Nobility, to serve as member of a jury. Usually it is the least senior member of a
panel of judges who decides who will be a juror. Jurors who refuse to serve can be
charged with the crime of disregarding the Queen's law, which can bring up to eight
years in prison.

Each jury, save for the Parliament of Nobles acting as a jury for their own peers, is 
comprised of nine members. At least six of the nine members must agree to a judgment of
guilty; if this doesn't occur, then the court is obligated to find the accused to be
innocent.

## Trial Procedure


In the case of a criminal charge, this procedure is followed:

  - A constable determines that a crime was committed and turns the evidence
    over to the crown barristers.

  - The senior crown barrister for a province assigns the case to a member of the
    crown barristry. That barrister reviews the evidence and writes up a formal
    declaration of charges.

  - A court hearing is called within six days of the arrest, and the senior 
    member of the three-judge panel asks the crown barrister to read the 
    declaration of charges. If a hearing is not held within six days, the 
    accused is judged to be innocent and is released.

  - The accused is allowed to make a statement at this time; the statement must
    be one of the following:

      - **Mercy:** A profession of guilt and a plea for the Queen's mercy
      - **Jury of Peers:** A declaration of innocence and a request for a jury trial
      - **Innocent:** A declaration of innocence and a request for a trial before the panel of judges

    In addition, if the accused has no defense barrister and cannot afford one, 
    they can request that one be assigned to them at the crown's expense.

  - If a jury trial is requested, the judges have thirty days in which to assemble
    the jury and reconvene the court. If the jury is not assembled within those 30
    days, the accused is judged to be innocent and is released.

  - If the trial will instead take place only before the panel of judges and not a
    jury, there is no need for the court to reconvene at a later date and thus the
    panel will move on to the testimony.

  - At this point, the crown barrister, the defense barrister, or the accused can
    request a delay of six days in order to prepare their arguments. If the accused
    has requested a crown-assigned defense barrister, the delay is automatically
    granted.

  - When the court reconvenes, the crown barrister is first allowed to present their
    argument for the guilt of the accused. If they wish to call witnesses, they can 
    do so at this time. Witnesses who aren't present can be issued an order to appear
    by the panel of judges, and if necessary, a delay of six days can be granted to
    compel the witnesses to answer.

  - Witnesses for either side can be questioned by the opposing party, except when
    the alleged victim or alleged perpetrator is asked to testify. Neither is required
    to do so, and the victim will only testify if the crown barrister requests it,
    and the accused will only testify at their own request or request of their defense
    barrister.

  - Once the crown barrister presents their case, the defense barrister can then
    present the case for an innocent verdict, including calling their own witnesses.

  - After both sides have finished their arguments, the body trying the case -- either
    the jury or the panel of judges -- take a vote as to whether the charges should be
    immediatley dismissed because the crown has not made its case. This requires a vote
    to dismiss by two of the three judges or six of the nine jurors, and the vote is a
    public vote taken in open court.

  - Assuming that the charges are not dismissed, the jurors or panel will then retire to 
    discuss the matter in private. They are given up to six days to arrive at a
    verdict; if a verdict is not given within six days, the charges are automatically
    dismissed.

  - If a verdict is reached, the court is reconvened. The senior judge again requests
    the crown barrister read the charges, and the accused is allowed to either

      - Profess their guilt and plea for the Queen's mercy
      - Declare their innocence and await the decision of the jury or judges

  - A verdict of guilty requires a vote of guilty by two of the three judges, or by
    six of the nine jurors. The vote is again taken in open court.

  - In a jury trial, the panel of judges can, by unanimous vote, choose to set
    aside a guilty verdict by the jury, and declare the accused to be innocent. They
    cannot set aside a verdict of innocence.

  - Once a verdict has been entered, the accused will either be declared innocent
    and set free, or will be declared guilty and a sentence will be imposed, to
    begin immediately after the court adjourns. Sentences are imposed only by the
    panel of judges, never by the juries.

  - At this point, an accused who has been found guilty has one final chance to
    ask for the Queen's mercy, although it requires a unanimous vote by the
    panel of judges to grant such a request.

  - If a payment is required, a convicted party must make that payment within six
    days or be sentence to prison by the panel of judges. If a flogging, banishment,
    or execution is required, the crown must carry it out within six days or else 
    the accused is judged innocent and is immediately released.

  - Once the trial concludes, the accused cannot be tried for these crimes again,
    whether they were found guilty or innocent. This also precludes a right to
    appeal a verdict of guilty. Once sentenced, the only way that someone can
    avoid the decree of the court is by a pardon from the Queen herself. Such
    pardons are usually only granted at the advice of the ministry of justice.

## Sentencing Guidelines

Generally, Gallinean justice demands that punishments not be excessive.
Execution was traditionally allowed only in the case of murder. This
was changed by Elisse III, making even murderers only eligible for,
at most, a lifetime imprisonment. Talk among the royal court at the time
indicated she would soon reduce the penalty for treason to indefinite
imprisonment as well, eliminating executions entirely -- but her
untimely death ironically prevented her from doing so.

The following table lists some of the most common crimes and their
punishments.

Table: Crimes in Lutetia

| Crime              | Punishment                                                        |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple theft       | Repayment of three times the value                                | 
| Grand theft        | Whipping and repayment                                            |
| Assault            | Imprisonment 1-10 years                                           |
| Smuggling          | Imprisonment 1-12 years or banishment                             |
| Attempted Murder   | Banishment                                                        |
| Murder             | Indefinite Imprisonment                                           |
| Abuse of Authority | Tripling the imprisonment and/or tripling the monetary fine       |
| Repeat Offensives  | Tripling the imprisonment and/or tripling the monetary fine       |
| Treason            | Execution                                                         |

Repeat offenses are punished more harshly, as are crimes by constables, judges, barristers,
ministers of the court, city watch, military officers, and others who act in the Queen's
name.

Pleading guilty and asking for the Queen's justice usually results in a reduced term of 
imprisonment compared to pleading innocent and requesting a trial.

:# Game Rules for Trials

It's possible that your player characters -- or important NPCs -- might be
arrested and put on trial.
You can make trials as mechanically complex as you want. Here are some
options, from most simple to most complex.

  - You just decide that the truth wins out. Lutetian courts are meant 
    to be fair, and so if a player is guilty, she is convicted; if she's
    innocent, she's exonerated.

  - You can decide the system is rigged, and false conviction or false
    exoneration will carry the day. This is useful if you want to call
    the entire system into question.

  - You can have the player characters present their arguments, then you
    make a decision by roleplaying the jury or panel of judges, based
    on the players' arguments.

  - The result of the trial can be decided by a simple skill roll. If
    the players are guilty, they can roll an Interaction (Deceive) to
    convince the jury they're innocent, and if the players are innocent,
    they can use either Interaction (Inspire) or Observation (Deduce) to
    present a solid defense. Standard Opposition of 3D8 or 3D10 is right
    for most trials.

  - Alternately, you can treat the trial as a debate between the two sides,
    and make it an opposed Interaction check against the NPC crown barrister.

  - You can make the trial a complex skill check at every point along the way,
    using Scholarship, Deduce, Intuition, Deceive, Inspire, Negotiate, 
    Etiquette, and other appropriate specialties.
    
If the player characters hire a barrister, you should allow one of the players
to roll the dice pools; don't roll against yourself.
