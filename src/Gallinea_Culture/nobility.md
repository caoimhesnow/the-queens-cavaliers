# Nobility in Gallinea {.cbreakbefore}

The 46 provinces that comprise Gallinea evolved from the feudal system of
the 7th and 8th centuries following the fall of Qarta. These provinces continue
to this day in the form of duchies, marquessates, counties, and viscounties,
and those who lead each province are considered nobility.

The highest ranking noble is, of course, the Queen of Gallinea, who is also the
Royal Duchess of Lutetia. If the monarch is male, his title is "King-Regnant"
or simply King.

The Queen's spouse is known is as the Princess-Consort. Members of the royal
family are themselves princesses or princes, if they lack other noble titles.

The families of other nobles inherit the title of baroness, and are refered
to as "ladies" or "lords". The lowest level of nobility is the baronetess,
a title that is bestowed by the Queen and is not inherited by one's heirs.

Noble titles descend in a matrilinear fashion, with the oldest daughter usually
inheriting the title. If there is no daughter, the title may pass to the oldest
son, or to a sister of the noble. Most titles are inherited upon the death of
the holder, although abdication is not unknown.

The noble titles used in Gallinea are shown on the following table.

Table: Noble Titles

| Title               | Male Equivalent | Spouse           | Child    |
| :------------------ | :-------------- | :--------------- | :------- |
| Queen               | King-Regnant    | Princess-Consort | Princess |
| Princess-Consort    | Prince-Consort  | Queen            | Princess |
| Princess            | Prince          | Baroness         | Princess |
| Duchess             | Duke            | Baroness         | Baroness |
| Marquise            | Marquis         | Baroness         | Baroness |
| Countess            | Count           | Baroness         | Baroness |
| Viscountess         | Viscount        | Baroness         | Baroness |
| Baroness            | Baron           | *none*           | Baroness |
| Baronetess          | Baronet         | *none*           | *none*   |

Most of Gallinean's neighbors use similar titles, albeit in their own languages.
Each Varendish state considers itself to be a separate country, with
titles ranging from *könig* and *erzherzog* to *graf* and *ritter*.
Ekalia claims to have no royalty and no nobility, although the Electors who
serve on the Plenum are, for all intents and purposes, effectively nobility.

## Traditionalists

Nobles in Gallinea are generally divided into two camps, and have been since 
Queen Elisse III started making sweeping changes in Gallinean society. On one
side, the *Traditionalists* reject the Elissian Reforms, while on the other,
the *Loyalists* stand behind Elisse's reforms and support the crown without
question.

Traditionalists believe that while Elisse had the right to make her pronouncements,
they were too fast and too many, with too little thought as to the consequences.
Gender equality for men, for example, is certainly a worthy goal, but not one that
must be pursued if it means upsetting the standards of Gallinean society that
have stood for centuries. Welcoming Ifrani immigrants, Devraist adherents, and
Talanian refugees risks changing the character of Gallinea, and if Gallinea is
no longer Gallinean -- then what is it?

The Traditionalists even point to the assassination of Queen Elisse as proof
that her policies failed. While no Gallinean patriot would applaud the death of
the queen, Traditionalists view her tragic murder as a disaster of her own making.
If she had stuck to tradition, as the nobles had urged her repeatedly, no doubt
she would still be on the Pegasus Throne today.

## Loyalists

The Loyalists are the smaller faction among Gallinean nobility, and even their
self-bestowed title is controversial: the Traditionalists protest that they are
as loyal to the crown as any, and instead label the Loyalist camp as the
Elissiennes.

Loyalists, despite claims from the opposition to the contrary, are not empty-headed
idealists with their heads in the clouds. They are well aware that the Elissian
Reforms not only threatened traditional Gallinean society, but also their own
power and fortune as the nobility of the country. They are willing to put their
self-interest aside for a number of reasons, including personal loyalty to 
Elisse, patriotic respect for the crown, or simply an educated stance that the
Reforms are good for the country.

Elisse's death shook the Loyalists to the core, but most pledged, in the late Queen's
memory, to support her younger daughter and successor, Mariana. However, support
continues to waver on the fringes of the Loyalist faction, with the Traditionalists
being able to peel off some of the more conservative nobles. Those who won't fully
support the Traditionalist cause will declare themselves neutral between the factions, 
high-mindedly adhering to the middle road of moderation and compromise.

A listing of the factions is shown in the following table.
