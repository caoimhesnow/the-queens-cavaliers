# The Gallinean Calendar {.cbreakbefore}

Years in Elara are measured from the abandonment of Qarta (Post Qarta), which dates to 1 PQ. Dates before 1 PQ are dated backwards with Before Qarta (BQ). A year without PQ/BQ notation is presumed to be PQ.

## Months ##

Months are named for the common weather in Lutetia during each month.

The neighboring countries have their own days for the months in their own languages. For example, in Albian, the months are Rainous, Windous, Buddal, Floweral, Meadowal, Reapidor, Heatidor, Fruitidor, Vintagearious, Fogarious, Frostarious, and Snowous.

Each month has 30 days. Each year has 360 days.

## Days of the Week

There are six days of the week in the Gallinean calendar. There are 5 weeks in every month.

Table: Days of the Week

| Number | Day Name   |
| :----: | :--------- |
| 1      | Moon Day   |
| 2      | Second Day |
| 3      | Third Day  |
| 4      | Fourth Day |
| 5      | Stars Day  |
| 6      | Sun Day    |

Asrian worship services are held on Sun Day, which is usually a day off for most. Devrans worship the Desert Goddess on Moon Day, after the sun has gone down.

## Monthly Calendar

Because there are five six-day weeks in every month, each month's calendar is the same. Thus, every full moon is on the 1st of the month and every new moon on the 16th.

Table: Monthly Calendar

| Moon Day | Seconday | Thirday | Fourday | Stars Day | Sun Day | Week Name   |
| :------: | :------: | :-----: | :-----: | :-------: | :-----: | :---------- |
| 1        | 2        | 3       | 4       | 5         | 6       | First Week  |

## Random Dates

The structure of the Gallinean calendar makes it very easy to create a random date.

For the month, simply roll 1D12 and use the table above. For a day of the week, roll 1D6 with 1 as Moon Day and 6 as Sun Day.
To find a random day of the month, first determine the week by rolling 1D10, then 1D6 to discover the day during that week.

Table: Random Day of the Month

| D10 Roll | D6 = 1           | D6 = 2            | D6 = 3          | D6 = 4          | D6 = 5            | D6 = 6          |
| :------: | :--------------- | :---------------  | :-------------- | :-------------- | :---------------- | :-------------- |
| 1-2      |  1st, a Moon Day |  2nd, a Seconday  |  3rd, a Thirday |  4th, a Fourday |  5th, a Stars Day |  6th, a Sun Day |
| 3-4      |  7th, a Moon Day |  8th, a Seconday  |  9th, a Thirday | 10th, a Fourday | 11th, a Stars Day | 12th, a Sun Day |
| 5-6      | 13th, a Moon Day | 14th, a Seconday  | 15th, a Thirday | 16th, a Fourday | 17th, a Stars Day | 18th, a Sun Day |
| 7-8      | 19th, a Moon Day | 20th, a Seconday  | 21st, a Thirday | 22nd, a Fourday | 23rd, a Stars Day | 24th, a Sun Day |
| 9-10     | 25th, a Moon Day | 26th, a Seconday  | 27th, a Thirday | 28th, a Fourday | 29th, a Stars Day | 30th, a Sun Day |

:# A Random Birthday

You can use the method described above to determine
a random birthday for a character. For example, Dani
decides to determine her character's birthday. First
she rolls 1D12 to find the date, and gets 5. This
corresponds to the 5th month, Prairial. Then she
rolls 1D10 and 1D6, getting 7 and 3 respectively.
This corresponds to the 21st. Therefore, her character
was born on 21 Prairial, which was a Thirday.
