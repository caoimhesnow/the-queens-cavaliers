# Science and Technology in Gallinea {.cbreakbefore}

Gallinea has a relatively advanced understanding of science and technology.

## Clockworks

Most Gallinean technology is based on clockwork mechanisms. Not quite steam
technology, clockwork mechanisms use gears, pulleys, levers, and other simple
components to create a wide variety of effects.

Among the most common clockwork devices are pocketwatches, spring-loaded knife
sheaths or pistol holsters, wing-gliders that can arrest a fall, and clockwork
weapons such as gearswords.

## Blackpowder

Blackpowder weapons replaced bows and crossbows a few centuries back, and the
current state of the art in personal weaponry are the flintlock pistol and musket. 
Blackpowder guns that can fire more than one shot without reloading are still
rare, although double pistols and double muskets are becoming more readily
available. Grenades are also made using blackpowder charges and can lead to
deadly injury.

In addition, blackpowder is used in cannons of all kind and size, from the smallest
portable mortar to the huge port guns guarding Rhodope Harbor.

### Phlogistone

Phlogistone was long thought a worthless byproduct of mining the ores used to create
blackpowder, but in 1212, a Varendish powdersmith discovered a method for burning
phlogistone. The fumes emitted when phlogistone is burned have remarkable properties --
they are able to lift and hold aloft more weight than could be explained by either the
heat of the fumes or the presence of light gases.

Within a few decades, phlogistone furnaces had advanced to the point that it would
be practical to mount them on ships that would then rise from the water. Such "airships"
had a great tactical advantage over ordinary sea-going ships, not to mention their
ability to bypass mountains, fields, and entire armies.

The largest concentrations of phlogistone were found in Varendia and in West Ifran.
Almost overnight, the previously ignored colonies of Elissia, New Dunon, and New Cordera became
boom towns, home to prospectors and opportunists.

Conflicting claims between New Dunon and Elissia, as well as accusations of privateers
with letters of marque preying on rival ships, led to increased hostility between Albia
and Gallinea, ultimately resulting in the brutal Twenty Years' War.

## Medicine

The roots of Gallinean medicine run deep, originating in both the midwives of the aboriginal
Brigue culture and the anatomists of the Qartan Empire. Gallinea is considered to be
second only to Albia in terms of medical science.

Gallineans understand the circulation of blood, the basics of reproduction, and the
treatment of most diseases. Clockwork microscopes are just barely advanced enough to
see bacteria, protozoa, and larger cells. The woman-centric roots of native Gallinean
medicine have led to childbirth, abortion, menstruation relief, mastectomies, hormone
treatment, and genital construction surgery being safe and relatively common procedures.

Surgery remains risky, although Albian understanding of disease and infection has helped
to reduce the chances of complications. Alchemical formulations such as draughts and
salves have also advanced medical care in Gallinea and improved health for most Gallineans.
