# *The Amazing Adventures of Alais de Neversette* {.cbreakbefore}

In the year 1199 PQ, a previously unknown writer named M.E. Labouret published a 
novel called *The Laughing Blade* that introduced a new character, Alais de Neversette.

*The Laughing Blade* took Lutetia by storm, and for the last fifty years there has
been at least one book published in the official line, *The Amazing Adventures of Alais Neversette* -- and many
other knock-off novels -- save for the darkest year of 1244.

## Alais de Neversette

Alais lives in the first half of the reign of Queen Delphine -- usually said to be 
the 1150s to 1160s -- and is the daughter of a minor noblewoman who snuck out from 
her studies and saved Princess-Regent Clarisse, the young queen's stepmother, 
from an assassination attempt. This bravery earned her a spot in the Queen's Cavaliers, 
over the objections of her doting mother and father.

Alais de Neversette is known for three qualities: her reckless abandon, her sexual 
promiscuity, and her love for wordplay. In the earliest stories she had a pronounced 
sexist streak -- quite biased against males (even as she romanced them for the cause 
of the Queen) -- but that aspect has been played down in recent years. She is bisexual 
and her relationships -- be they with women, men, or others -- legendarily end in 
heartbreak or death by the end of each novel.

Starting with the second book in 1200 PQ, the titles all began with *Alais de Neversette and ...*,
and in 1203 the core line of books began being called by the collective title 
*The Amazing Adventures of Alais de Neversette.* Several additional series have appeared, 
including *The Nautical Adventures of Alais de Neversette,* 
*The Secret Adventures of Alais de Neversette,* *The Erotic Adventures of Alais de Neversette,* 
and *The Wartime Adventures of Alais de Neversette.* Each series takes a different approach to the character; 
*Wartime* is about her fictional exploits published during the 20 Years War, 
for example, while *Erotic* is decidedly not for children.

## Authorship

The exact identity of M.E. Labouret is unknown, and it's said that even her -- or his, or their -- publishers 
don't know her true identity. The leading theory held by Alais scholars is that Labouret is a pen named 
shared by several people over the years, perhaps a family, as distinctive patterns run through certain 
books and not others. Most scholars agree that the writer(s) of Alais are natives of Lutetia, 
and probably from the educated artisan class.

The mysterious nature of the author also has led to a number of books and stories being written under the 
name "M.E. Labouret" but printed by other publishers. Only those produced by Marini-Fell Printing Press
are considered to be authentic.

Highly popular among the common people, Alais is dismissed as dreadfully overwritten 
prose among those who fancy themselves more educated -- although the enduring popularity 
of the character and her books have led a minority of scholars to take a greater interest in the books.

## Reception

The *Alais* books are reviled by many of the older members of the Queen's Cavaliers as they present a 
wholly unrealistic and slightly ridiculous view of life in the Queen's service, 
but in recent years, many of the new recruits are people who have grown up reading about Alais. 
Despite the greyswords' opinions, the *Adventures* may be one of the greatest recruiting tools for the 
Cavaliers and a source of at least some of the public goodwill toward the Queen's Cavaliers.

Several of Alais de Neversette's fictional adventures have been adapted for the stage. 
Most of these have been performed only in the smaller or common theatres of Gallinea, but a few 
have had higher profile performances -- although none in front of a royal audience.

"The Laughing Blade" is the story most often adapted for these plays, often titled as 
"Alais de Neversette and the Laughing Blade." A musical version of "The Nautical Adventures of 
Alais de Neversette: Alais de Neversette and the Hidden Reef" is one of the largest crowd-pleasers, 
and has given young Lutetians the idea that all pirates are singing pirates.

Rachel is running a game of *The Queen's Cavaliers* and decides to hide a
clue in a Alais de Neversette novel that's laying around in Farrazin's
study.

First she rolls a D12 for the genre, and gets 7, "Mysterious." This is going to be a mystery novel
where Alais helps solve a crime.

Next, she rolls a D12 and a D6 to see if there's a prepositional phrase. She gets 11 and 3, which
cross-references to "Revenge of." That makes sense with the mystery genre; obviously it's a crime
of vengeance.

For the adjective, she rolls a D10 and a D6, getting 7 and 4. She cross-references these to get the
adjective "Noble."

Then she rolls 8 on a D12 and 2 on a D6, which results in "Priestess."

Putting these together, she finds the book is named 
*The Mysterious Adventures of Alais de Neversette: Alais de Neversette and the Revenge of the Noble Priestess*.

Sounds like light reading on a rainy Sun Day for the arch-chaplain!

Do you need to come up with an adventure idea? You can just roll on the Alais
de Neversette titles but leave off the "Alais" parts. So your adventure idea
could be *"The Revenge of the Noble Priestess."* Who is the priestess? Who is
the target of her revenge? Is she called "noble" because she's of high birth
or because her cause is just? You get to decide!
