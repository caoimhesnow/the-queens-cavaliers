# Units of Measure {.breakbefore}

Various units of measurement are used throughout Elara and Ifran, most of which are based on the Qartan Empire's standardized units. 
The units on this page are those used in Gallinea, 
although there are equivalent units in most other countries descended from Qarta.

## Length and Distance

The basic measure of length is the *pied de la reine*, or *pied* for short.

Table: Units of Length and Distance

| Unit                         | Relative Value | SI Value  |
| :--------------------------- | :------------: | --------: |
| *pouce* or inch              | 1/12           | 27 mm     |
| *pied de la reine* or foot   | 1              | 32.5 cm   |
| *toise* or fathom            | 6              | 1.95 m    |
| *perche* or perch            | 22             | 7.15 m    |
| *arpent*                     | 220            | 71.5 m    |
| *lieue* or league            | 10,000         | 3.25 km   |

Different measures are used for different purposes. A *toise*, which is about two yards, is used for measuring depth at sea,
while a *lieue* is the distance someone can easily walk in an hour, or about 2 miles.

## Area

The basic measure of area is the *pied carré*, which is defined as a square that is 1 *pied* per side.

Table: Units of Area

| Unit                            | Relative Value | Per Side      | SI Value   |
| :------------------------------ | :------------: | :-----------: | :--------: |
| *pied carré* or square foot     | 1              | 1 *pied*      | 1055 sq cm |
| *toise carrée* or square fathom | 36             | 6 *pied*      | 3.8  sq m  |
| *perche carrée* or square perch | 484            | 22 *pied*     | 51 sq m    |
| *vergée*                        | 12,100         | 110 *pied*    | 1,280 sq m |
| *arpent carré* or acre          | 48,400         | 220 *pied*    | 5,100 sq m |
| *lieue carrée* or square league | 100,000,000    | 10,000 *pied* | 10.5 sq km |

An *arpet carré* is roughly equal to 1.25 real-world acres, while a *lieue carrée* is 2,600 acres or 4 square miles.

## Weight

The basic measure of weight is the *livre*, which is roughly equal to a U.S. pound.

Table: Units of Weight

| Unit                   | Relative Value | SI Value  |
| :--------------------- | :------------: | --------: |
| *once* or ounce        | 1/16           | 30.6 g    |
| *marc* or half pound   | 1/2            | 245 g     |
| *livre* or pound       | 1              | 490 g     |
| *quintal*              | 100            | 49 kg     |

A *quintal* is just over 100 real-world pounds.

## Liquid Volume

The basic measure of liquid is the *pinte*.

Table: Units of Liquid Volume

| Unit         | Relative Value | SI Value  |
| :----------- | :------------: | --------: |
| *demiard*    | 1/4            | 238 ml    |
| *chopine*    | 1/2            | 4.8 ml    |
| *pinte*      | 1              | 950 ml    |
| *quade*      | 2              | 1.9 L     |
| *velte*      | 8              | 7.6 L     |
| *barrique*   | 236            | 225 L     |

A *chopine* is about the size of a real-world (US) pint and is the normal size for an alcohol drink. A *pinte* is nearly a liter and
is a large drink indeed. A *quade* is about half a gallon, while a *velte* is two gallons. The *barrique* is a 60-gallon barrel of 
wine, beer, or some other alcohol.
