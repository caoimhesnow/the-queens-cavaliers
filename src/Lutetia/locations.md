# Organization

The city of Lutetia and the immediately surrounding countryside are
ruled by the Queen of Gallinea as a royal province, but the day-to-day
adminstration of the city is turned over to the Lady-Mayor of Lutetia.
The Lady-Mayor (or, sometimes, Lord-Mayor) is appointed directly by the
Queen herself and serves at the Queen's pleasure, although it's
traditional for a term as Lady-Mayor to last for five years.

The current Lady-Mayor of Lutetia is Lusienne, countess of Castenia, who
has been in office for three years now. Lady-Mayor Lusienne is skilled
at playing the various nobles, guildmasters, and ambassadors of the
Royal Court off each other, preserving the interests of the Queen while
allowing Her Majesty to remain above much of the petty politicking.

## The Bridges of Lutetia

Lutetia is divided up into 55 different *arrondissements*, or
neighborhoods, named after the 16 bridges that span the Luisante. When a
resident of Lutetia speaks of her location or address within the city,
she talks of arrondissement of that location. Lutetian arrondissements
are mostly wedge-shaped neighborhoods that reach out from the central
islands to the edge of the city.

:# The 17th Bridge

There are sixteen bridges leading across the lake to the great city of Lutetia. The saying 
goes, "For every person, there is a bridge" - all are welcome in Lutetia, be they nobles, 
commoners, Gallineans or foreigners. By the same token, if one is said to 
be "Seeking the Seventeenth Bridge", that one is someone who has not found their path in life. 
Such outcasts should not be pitied, for it may be that they will find their path - or, 
failing that, forge a new one out of the stone...
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

There are usually four parts to an arrondissement – the portion on a
central island, the bridge itself, the section on one of the banks of
the Luisante but within the Old Wall, and the corresponding region
outside the Wall. 

These sections are referred to as *sur l'île* ("on the island"), *sur le pont*
("on the bridge"), *travers le pont* ("across the bridge"), and *delà du mur*
(beyond the wall). Thus, a resident could speak of her home as being
in the "8th *arrondissement, delà du mur*", and her school in the "*7th travers le pont"*.

Some exceptions exist. Île Royale, the home of the royal palace, is
always just Île Royale, its own arrondissement. The 1st Bridge spans the
Luisante but not the islands, so the two sides are *rive ouest* (West
Bank) and *rive est* (East bank). Because of the geography of the islands,
there is no *delà du mur* for the 4th, 5th, and 12th Bridges.

Traditionally, addresses are given in Old Gallinean, although it's become
increasingly common among Lutetians to simply use the modern equivalent for
locations. It's understood when one says simply the ordinal name, the
"arrondissement" is silent. For example, "6th *sur le pont*" is a shorter
way of saying "6th *arrondissement, sur le pont* (on the bridge)." 

The following table summarizes Lutetian addresses.

Table: Addresses in Lutetia

| :-------------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------- |

| *sur le pont*         | *slp* or *pont*     | "On the bridge"                       | Pont de Coeur *sur le pont*  |
| *travers le pont*     | *tlp* or *travers*  | "Across the bridge (inside the wall)" | 15 *tlp*                     |
| *delà du mur*         | *ddm* or *du mur*   | "Beyond the wall"                     | Beyond the South Bridge      |

# Features of the City

The most notable feature of Lutetia is the Luisante River, which flows
from headwaters in the northern part of Gallinea through the city, where
it forms Luisante Lake. The Luisante then flows south through the
country to Valerienne, where it empties into the Middle Sea.

Luisante means “sparkling” and the river mostly lives up to its name
until it enters the capital, where the extensive underground Lutetian
sewer system meets its waters. The sides of the river are reinforced
with stone walls that form hard channels to control the Luisante until
it spills into the lake to the south of the city.

:::::::::::::::::::::: sidebar :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:# Lutetian Idioms

Many Lutetian colloquialisms relate to the names of the arrondissements. As they are in
Gallinean but rely on knowledge of the layout of the city, these terms can be 
incomprehensible to outsiders. The Lutetians tend to use these as a shibboleth to
judge others' experience in the city.

  - Someone who is said to be *12 delà du mur* is someone who has escaped from La Roche Prison.
  - *4 delà du mur* is a Lutetian expression meaning "from outside of Lutetia," 
    and is a mildly derogatory for non-Lutetians.
  - Newcomers to Lutetia are often directed to the non-existent *1st Bridge, sur l'île* as a 
    humorous snipe hunt.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The four islands at the center of the city are the oldest parts of
Lutetia. The first Qartan settlements were on the largest island, 
**Île de Lutetia**, which was originally surrounded by a wooden, and later stone,
wall. Only a few signs of this original wall remain today, mostly in a
few random sides of old buildings overlooking the river.

The next largest island, **Île Royale**, is home to the royal palace. The
two smaller islands, **Île Citadelle** and **Île Rocheuse**, are named for the
stone castles that dominate each.

The Old Wall, also known as Prisca's Wall, was built to surround the islands 
and the parts of the city on the east and west banks of the Luisante, but in recent decades
Lutetia has overgrown the boundaries of the wall and expanded out
further into the Gallinean countryside.

Besides the two castles on Île Citadelle and Île Rocheuse, Lutetia is
defended by three stone fortresses ringing the city – **La Guette** to the
northwest, **l'Arsenal** to the east, and **Le Puissant** to the southwest. The
newly constructed **Airship Tower** at Le Puissant serves an important role
in protecting the city from aerial assault.

Four ancient roads, dating back to the days of the Qartan Empire, meet
in Lutetia on the central Île de Lutetia: Rue de la Rivière, Rue de
Scanbria, Rue du Coeur, and Rue du Sud. Gardens and parks abound in
Lutetia, most notably those along the entire length of the Rue du Coeur
on the central island – which is the scene for many parades and
festivals throughout the year.

The laws of Gallinea are enforced by the city's constabulatory,
operating out of small precinct houses around Lutetia and centered in La
Roche, a converted castle now used as a prison on Île Rocheuse. Those
who break the law are tried in the courts of the Palais de Justice.

# Lutetian Landmarks {.breakbefore}

Many of the iconic buildings of Lutetia are known far and wide throughout
Gallinea, even to those who merely read about them in books without having
visited the city.

Some of the most prominent landmarks are listed in the following table.

## Île Royale

The Royal Island is the second-largest of the Lutetian islands and, as the name implies, is home
to the Royal Palace. By laws dating back to the 10th century, only the royal family is allowed to
live on the island or own property there. 

While most buildings are occupied by retainers of the
court or offices of the crown, the northern tip of the island is a park known as
La Fruitière Royale, where all residents of Lutetia are welcome to pick from the many citrus
trees that line its meandering walkways. Lutetian tradition holds that an old curse will fall
on anyone who picks more than one piece of fruit in a given year, however. For this reason,
the park is the busiest on the first day of the year.

On Île Royale, you may find:

  - royal and noble carriages moving through the streets
  - the Queen's Royal Guard
  - couriers delivering messages
  - visitors hoping to catch a glimpse of the queen or other royals
  - museums owned by the royal family
  - government functionaries
  - artisans and merchants meeting with inspectors

:# A
:# Royal Palace

The **Royal Palace of Gallinea** is, naturally, the home of the Queen and her family. The throne of Gallinea is
here, its silver pegasus wings arching protectively over the head of the current monarch.

Although Cavaliers are considered servants of the Queen, they don't have unfettered access
to Her Majesty. A bureaucratic staff of hundreds stands ready to block anyone who isn't 
expressly summoned to the palace to approach Mariana.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## 1st Bridge, Pont Nord

:# Z
:# La Guette

**Château de la Guette** was constructed in the 9th century as it became apparant that Lutetia
was destined to grow beyond the borders of Prisca's Wall. Meant to counter a threat from
Scanbria, Varendia, and Albia, the once-distant castle is now fully surrounded by the
urban sprawl.

While the Queen's Army still staffs the castle, it's also known as Le Château Noir -- not
simply because of the dark Montambrean stone from which it was built, but also because it
is the headquarters of the Lutetian intelligence service. Le Prince de Zibeline himself,
Jean-Remy, occupies the inner keep and his operatives a full wing of the outer keep.

Jean-Remy's guards usually admit no one saved his top operatives, although it's been said that if
you need to see Gallinea's spymaster, he already knows, and word will be left at the 
castle gates. Few wish to test this rumor.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## 3rd Bridge, Pont à l'Ouest

Pont à l'Ouest is just to the South and West of the Palace. It is often called the Tradesman’s 
Bridge. This is where each tradesperson or merchant comes to be presented the the Minister of

and their goods for inspection to one of the financial officers for the Queendom -- 
although the shadier businesses usually find a way around around these legalities.

:# l'Academie

Officers in the Queen's Army are trained in **l'Academie d'Officiers Militaires** by a 
staff of retired military and civilian historians. Only on rare occasions will a Cavalier
receive further training here, as the rank of "cavalier" is already considered equal to a military officer.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## 4th Bridge, Pont Interne

Pont Interne is one of two bridges that do not connect one of the islands to the mainland, 
but one island to another. This bridge is often called "the Traitor’s Bridge" because it 
is the main thoroughfare for prisoners taken from the Royal Palace to the Palais de Justice.

On 4th *sur le pont*, you may find:

  - apartments for judges and crown barristers [(Nobility D10 social rank)]{.gamestats}

city, and is the center of law in Lutetia. The courts of justice are in the east
wing, and the legislature in the west. Most of the west wing is taken up by the
The middle portion of the Palace of Justice is taken up by The Central Chamber,
a three-layered meeting hall where Lutetia's three deliberative bodies meet -- the
Parliament of Nobles, the Assembly of Guilds, and the Convocation of Veterans.

The Minister of Justice usually maintains an office in this building,
but Minister Farrazin prefers to spend the majority of his time in the
Grand Cathedral rather than the Palace of Justice.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## 5th Bridge, Pont Est

Pont Est is the second of the inter-island bridges.  It connects Île Royale to 
Île Citadelle. This is often called the Cavalier's bridge as the Citadel is the 
home of the Queen's Cavaliers. The Citadel was once the main castle for the Royal Family 
as it was thought more easily protected.  In the more recent peaceful past the family 
was able to stay in a more central and easily accessible location.

On 5th *sur le pont*, you may find:

  - apartments for senior and honorably retired Cavaliers [(Artisan D8 social rank)]{.gamestats}
  - off-duty Cavaliers
  - the Queen's Elite Guard

:# B
:# The Citadel

The oldest castle built in Gallinea is a grand structure, the type of
architecture that isn't made any more. The towers of **The Citadel** rise
nearly as high as the Cathedral to the southwest, although not nearly as
tall as the spires of the Royal Palace.

Training grounds and barracks are found in the outer keep, while the inner
keep contains the Cavaliers' armory, the commandant's quarters, and
other specialized rooms such as workshops.

## 7th Bridge, Pont des Universités

Pont des Universités is where many of the cavaliers who don't live in the 
Citadel can be found. The bridge is named for the Universities of Lutetia,
which offer a broad education on a number of topics. Just south of the
university is the mechanician district, which features a variety of
small clockwork shops around the Mechanicians' Guild.

Lutetia. The universities consist of:

  - The Royal Gallinean Academy of Sciences
  - The University of Letters and Arts
  - Lutetia College of History

Among the scholars at the universities is renowned cartographer S.A. Piento,

Located across the river from Île Citadelle is
the **Mechanicians' Guildhall**. The Guildhall is perhaps best known for
the massive clockface on its west wall, facing toward the inner islands
of Lutetia. Although the nearby residents complain about the constant
clacking of the massive gears, the rest of Lutetia has grown accustomed
to hearing its bells on the hour, every hour of daylight.

Madame Feline Porvore, the mistress of the Mechanicians' Guild, is
often found here, her balloonship at rest in the guildhall's courtyard.

**La Grande Cathédrale de la Déesse-Impératrice du Soleil** is a massive structure
that dominates the northern half of Île de Lutetia, situated on a rise known as 
Temple Hill. Besides its tall spires, the Cathedral is also known for the large
glass windows on either end of the building, shaped as *soleils-de-essere*.

Arch-Chaplain Farrazin, Guardian of the Faith of Gallinea, resides in the 
Grand Cathedral, and his Holy Guardsmen have barracks on the surrounding courtyards.
Cavaliers who come to the Cathedral on official duty are expected to check in with
the Holy Guardsmen's Duty Captain.

**L'Infirmerie** is the largest hospital in the city, originally established to
move the sick and diseased off the central island. In the four centuries since,
L'Infirmerie has outgrown its buildings twice, having relocated to the current
location a mere 12 years back.

Cavaliers seeking medical care may find it here, but are expected to pay for
their health. Only Lutetia's poorest receive free health care here, although
one of late queen Elisse's proposed reforms was to pay for the treatment of
*all* Lutetians from the royal treasury.

While other buildings have spires and towers, **L'Observatoire** is one of only
two buildings in Lutetia specifically constructed *as* towers. 

Located outside the walls of the city to avoid the lantern-light of the
central islands, the Observatory is a landmark that helps many Lutetians navigate
to Le Grand Parc, Lutetia's largest park and home of a weekly farmer's market.

L'Observatoire itself has telescopes trained on the skies day and night, using
fine glass optics imported from distant Ubar. The royal astrologer, Baron
Nasir Aldin Alubar, is the son of immigrants from Ubar and is one of the few
prominent Devrans in the city.

## 9th Bridge, Pont de Coeur

Pont de Coeur is a favorite of lovers of all ages. It offers many small tea and novelty shops 
as well as a thriving gondola tour. Here the Luisante river is narrowed and tamer.

Parks line the Rue du Coeur here, with monuments celebrating Lutetian and Gallinean history.
The east bank of the 9th is known for selling flowers, and nearly every window
has a planter with colorful blooms in the spring.

**Château de l'Arsenal**, located outside the Priscan Wall, is the official armory of 
the Queen's Army. The damage suffered by l'Arsenal during the Twenty Years' War led
to the construction of Le Puissant, Lutetia's newest fortress, built to the southeast
of the city.

L'Arsenal is used for weapons testing and development in addition to its primary defensive
purpose.

## 10th Bridge, Pont de Marché

Pont de Marché is the home of the Grand Market. This extends into 
Les Ruelles, where it's said you can find anything your heart desires. 
From there, you are an easy carriage ride over the Luisante to le Théâtre du Monde. 

Beyond the Priscan Wall is mostly residential space, which in recent years
has become home to a number of Ifrani immigrants. The changing character of the
arrondissement doesn't sit well with some of the older residents.

In 10th *sur l'ile*, you may find:

  - marketplace stalls
  - people looking to buy rare goods
  - shady dealers selling items of dubious provenance

The location now known as **Les Ruelles** has been a marketplace for centuries,
having been first established during the Qartan age of Lutetia. The central courtyard
is always packed with stalls and tents, creating a winding maze of trade goods, and
the surrounding blocks consist of larger buildings subdivided into smaller shops.

The legend is that if you can't find it in Les Ruelles, it doesn't exist. While that
may not be literally true, the market is still the best bet to find that special
item you can't locate anywhere else.

**The World Theater** is the largest and most prolific theater in Lutetia, 
welcoming audiences of all social levels to its immense central chamber.
Many Lutetians claim it is the greatest theater in all of Elara, although
fans of the Institute of Theatrics in Volstok, the Diegan Royal Opera House, or the
Thedan Forum might disagree.

The Du Monde is supported by a gift given upon the ascension of Queen Mariana I, ancestor 
of the current queen. There is at least one playwright and one musical 
conductor in residence. The Royal Minister of Theater is often a retired actor;
currently that position is held by Jeanne Antoinette Poisson, a favorite of 
late Queen Elisse from her childhood.

The Temple of the Moon is the only Devran shrine located in 
Lutetia, and if certain xenophobic elements of the city had
their way, even it would not exist.

In contrast to the ostentatious splendor of the Grand Cathedral
of the Sun, or the humble tranquility of the Garden Chapel,
the Temple of the Moon is a simple, unadorned building, originally
a warehouse for the nearby dock district but since converted and
rebuilt over the last forty years. Devran services are held daily,
with evening celebrations every new moon.

The chilly reception to Devrans since their rumored participation
in the assassination of Queen Elisse has led to acts of 
vandalism and even minor arson at the Temple of the Moon, and
the elder Speaker, Hatoon Nabataea, fears that the attacks against
her shrine may be escalatin. She may be skeptical of any 
Cavaliers who are not openly Devran.

## 11th Bridge, Pont Lac

The 11th Arrondissement is a study in contrasts -- from the high-end

In 11th *sur l'ile*, you may find:

  - auction houses and consignment stores
  - wealthy shoppers
  - small shops with jewelers and gemcutters
  - appraisers
  - private guards

Visitors to Lutetia are sometimes surprised to find **Les Quais**, the docks 
district, as they imagine only seaports to have such neighborhoods. However,
Lutetia is a major river port that does most of its trade via the Luisante, on
large riverboats that travel from as far as Valerienne.

Like most dock districts, Les Quais is a neighborhood of common workers, not
nobility or artisans. Rumors that link the docks to organized crime are at
best spurious gossip, at worst a cruel slander perpetrated by the upper classes.

## 12th Bridge, Pont Roche

Pont Roche is the only entry or exit to Île Rocheuse, home of La Roche Prison.  
The entire island is surrounded by a wall keeping it isolated from the lake.  
Pont Roche has a guard post at either end with a high gate on each.  
This Southernmost bridge itself is the home for most of the guards.  
This is the only bridge with no shops or public spaces.

Located on Île Rocheuse, La Roche was the second castle built in Gallinea, meant to defend
it from attacks from the south and vi the lake. It no longer serves that purpose, instead
being used to imprison those who break the Queen's Law.

While local legend says that no one has ever escaped The Rock, the truth is that a few
have managed this deed. Most notably, Prince Andiers of Persolei, sentenced in 997 to serve
the rest of his days in prison, managed to escape and made his way back to his home city,
before being killed trying to escape the Cavaliers who had been sent to return him.
Persoleian tall tales claim that he hid a treasure somewhere within La Roche itself but was unable
to return to Lutetia to reclaim it.

## 13th Bridge, Pont de la Rivière

On Ile de Lutetia, the 13th is the historic arts district, centered around 
a park and the Palais de Lutetia.

The parts of the 13th arrondissement outside the wall was purely a residential
area at first, but the land has since been bought to build the towering
castle of Le Puissant.

In 13th *sur l'ile*, you may find:

  - Lusienne Castenia herself, the Lady-Mayor of Lutetia, and her retinue
  - an overpriced inn catering to nobles [(Nobility D10 social rank)]{.gamestats}

**Palais de Lutetia** was built to be a home for the monarch of Gallinea,
but Queen Jehanne III found it to be lacking, and it was never occupied. Instead,
Jehanne ordered the construction of the current Royal Palace, and Palais de
Lutetia was instead given to the city to use as they wish.

This is the home of the countess of Castenia, the current lady-mayor of 
Lutetia. The Palais de Lutetia is also home to an extravagantly decorated private theatre. 
Countess Lucienne Castenia fancies herself a playwright and amuses herself by 
arranging theatricals in the personal theatre. There's probably a reason that none of the 
other theatres in the city have chosen to produce one of the lady-mayor's plays, but 
if so, nobody has seen fit to tell her yet.

The newest castle in Lutetia, **Le Puissant Château** is a formidable fortress of
grey stone walls that looms like a stone sentinel over the 13th and 14th
arrondissements, *delà du mur*. Its stark and unadorned walls are in decided
contrast to the classical stylings of the Citadel and La Roche, the flying buttresses
of l'Arsenal, or the dark, gothic gargoyles of La Guette. In the 25 years since
it was completed, the common consensus has formed that the drab but imposing Castle
Puissant is a modern eyesore compared to the lovely architecture found throughout
the island city.

Le Puissant is the headquarters for the Queen's Army, and Symonne Dargy, the aging
Maréchal de Gallinea, and her generals direct the movements of supplies and
soldiery from within the prosaic central keep.

**Le Théâtre de la Rive**, the newest theater in Gallinea,
caters to a more upscale audience. The theater director, Baronetess
Claudana Rith, boasts that the two-decades-old venue has never had
a performance of an Alais de Neversette play, and never will.

Instead, the River Theater offers serious dramatic fare and flawless
musical performances, all original compositions on the cutting edge of
the theater arts. With prices roughly four times that of the World,
many Lutetians complain that La Rive is keeping art from the masses,
a sentiment not keeping with Lutetia's cosmopolitan egalitarianism.

One of the newest landmarks in Lutetia is the new Airship Tower, built just
over 10 years ago. Primarily built to serve the military airships of the Queen's
Sky Navy, it now also serves private airships since the end of the war with Albia.

There are three levels to the tower, each reachable via steep flights of stairs
or the central clockwork elevators. The lowest has 6 skyberths and is most
commonly used by cargo airships who use the attached cranes to lower their goods
to the ground.

The second level has 8 berths and is usually used for passenger airships, including
diplomatic envoys from other countries and the rare sky-yacht owned by the most wealthy
of nobles.

The third level is reserved entirely for government airships, its 6 skyberths
almost always occupied by one of the twelve Queen's Sky Navy cruisers or *The
Zephyr*, the royal sky-yacht.

## 15th Bridge, Pont Grande

The Rue du Coeur cuts through the middle of the 15th arrondissement just as
it bisects the city itself. The largest statue in Lutetia can be found on
the parkside part the 15th, while the tranquility of the Garden Chapel
lies beyond Prisca's Wall. Between them, one can find the hazy Alchemy
District.

The bridge itself is known for the crepes sold there, both sweet and savory

:# La Dame de la Victoire

Built in 1169 following the death of former Princess-Regent and Princess-Consort Clarisse Sudelune,
**La Dame de la Victoire** commemorates the military hero's victory over Varendia. The
statue depicts her atop her horse, holding her sword to the sky, her mouth open to spur her
troops on to victory.

*La Dame*, called simply *Clarisse* by the cheekier citizens of Lutetia, is the most 
impressive of the many statues that line Rue du Coeur. To many Lutetians, the statue of
Clarisse symbolizes the entire city, even though Sudelune was herself not native to the
island city.

Starting in the reign of Queen Delphine, the daughter of Clarisse and Queen Elisse II, 
it became traditional for all parades along the Rue to pause at La Dame out of respect,
with military units offering salutes. Failure to do so, it's said, will bring misfortune
upon those who disrespect the spirit of Lutetia.

although it is held to be at least as beautiful in its own way.

Ornately carved leaves, flowers, vines, and branches adorn the stone
walls inside and out, with carefully cultivated sunflowers matching
the stonework that fill the ground outside. Inside the church, it's
become tradition to speak softly whenever there are not services,
giving the building a sense of reverent quietude.

Matriarch de la Justicia favors the Garden Chapel over the
Grand Cathedral, to Guardian Farrazin's chagrin. Isabene will always
stop at de Jardin on the way in to Lutetia when she visits, spending
several hours in the nearby Parc de la Chapelle among the gardens,
ignoring the messengers sent by Farrazin to hurry her along.

:# Charmweavers' Guildhall

Located in the middle of Lutetia's fashion district is the **Charmweavers' Guildhall**. 
From here, grandmaster charmweavers plan out the latest fashions and spin their charms
into apparel of all types.

The boutiques nearest the guildhall deal with only the most *haute couture*, while those
a few blocks away peddle clothing made for the masses. In addition to clothes, one can
also find any manner of accessories in the shops near the guildhall, from purses and footwear 
to wigs and masques.

:# Les Écuries
  
While horses are available all through Gallinea, **Les Écuries Royales de Lutetia**
are the royal stables, where horses for the Queen's Army are bred and raised. The
adjoining Parc de l'Écuries even has a race course where the fastest equestriennes
match their time against each other.

The Queen herself rarely visits the royal stables outside of ceremonial occasions,
but Prince-Consort Carolus has been known to inspect the riding horses, often in the company
of his countryman Lord-Ambassador Bedyngford.
