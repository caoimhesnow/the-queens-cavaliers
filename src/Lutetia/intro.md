Lutetia is a large metropolis of over 550,000 permanent residents that
sprawls across both banks of the Luisante river and four islands,
overlooking Lake Luisante. Sixteen wide bridges reach across the
Luisante, each one giving its name to the surrounding neighborhoods.

Lutetia is known for its majestic architecture as well as its green 
parks. Landmarks include the Royal Palace, the Universities of Lutetia, 
the Grand Cathedral, and the Gallinean Library.

Lady-Mayor Lusienne Castenia, the countess of Castenia, is the current 
lady-mayor of Lutetia, and is renowned as much for her lavish formal 
parties as her political scheming.
