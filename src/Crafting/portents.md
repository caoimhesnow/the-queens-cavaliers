### Portents

You can craft divination cards, astrological charts, and bibelots with the Magicks (Portents) specialty.

**Base Time:** Using Magicks (Portents) to draw astrological charts or
encharm bibelots takes one hour. Crafting divination cards takes one
day.

**Item Die:** Add the Item Die of your tools or workroom to your dice pool.

**Supplies:** Art media is required to produce items using Magicks (Portents).

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Magicks (Portents).

**Rushing:** You can reduce your crafting time by taking a Drop penalty
on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking extra time on.
The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush the crafting.

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically
succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the
creation.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Draw Astrological Charts (1 unit of art media):** You create a set of
astrological charts for someone based on the place, date, and time of
her birth. (Incorrect information will, of course, produce useless
charts!) The charts you create provide you with a +1D6 Item Die for
Magicks (Portents) rolls on that person.

**Improve Astrological Charts (1 unit of art media):** The Item Die of
the astrological charts improves by one die size. The Item Die is
limited by the number of specialty ranks you have in Magicks (Portents).

**Encharm Bibelot (1 unit of art media):** You create a single bibelot
  encharmed with a skill of your choice. More details on bibelots can
  be found <a href="#bibelots" class="xref-inchapter-under"></a>.

**Create Divination Cards (5 units of art media):** You create a
personalized deck of divination cards, either for yourself or for
someone whom you have astrological charts. The deck has an Item Die of
+1D6 which increases by one step for each additional success point you
spend, limited by the number of specialty ranks you in Magicks
(Portents). Your own deck also has a Bonus Die of +1D0, and you can
increase that by one step for each additional success point, limited by
your Portents ranks.
