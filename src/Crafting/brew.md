### Brew

You can craft draughts and salves using your skills at alchemy. You can also create medicine and poison antidotes.

**Base Time:** Brewing takes 1 hour.

**Item Die:** Add the Item Die of your alchemy tools or laboratory to your dice pool.

**Supplies:** Crafting with Brew requires the expenditure of alchemical
ingredients.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Magicks (Brew).

**Extra Supplies:** You can use extra supplies while crafting to add a
Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your
number of ranks in Magicks (Brew).

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to craft your creation by taking a
Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking
extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
the crafting.

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically
succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the
creation.
