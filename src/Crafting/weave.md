### Weave

You can craft articles of clothing, including charmwoven items.

**Base Time:** Crafting an article of clothing takes 1 hour.

**Item Die:** Add the Item Die of your tailoring tools or workshop to your dice pool.

**Supplies:** Creating clothes requires fabric supplies.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Magicks (Weave).

**Extra Supplies:** You can use extra supplies while crafting to add a
Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your
number of ranks in the Specialty.

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to craft your creation by taking a
Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking
extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
the crafting.

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically
succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the
creation.

**Craft Article of Clothing (1 unit of fabric):** You create a basic
article of clothing that is social rank Commoner (D0) or Soldier (D6).
If the social rank is Artisan (D8) or higher, you need to pay extra
success points to create it. If you spend one additional success
point, you can create an article of clothing that is social rank Artisan
(D8) or Noble (D10). If you have at least 4 ranks in Magicks (Weave),
you can spend one more success point to create an article of clothing
that is social rank Royal (D12).

**Add Charm to Clothing:** You add a charm to the article you created,
with a Charm Die of +1D6. The item must be in accordance with the
applicable Laws of Fashion, described <a href="#the-nine-laws-of-fashion" class="xref-inchapter-under">Nine Laws of Fashion</a>.

**Increase Charm (1 unit of fabric):** The Charm Die of the article of
clothing improves by one die size. You are limited by the number of
specialty ranks you have in Magicks (Weave).

**Reduce Material Cost:** You reduce the overall cost of this Crafting
roll by one unit of fabric.

**Masterpiece!:** You've created an amazing article of apparel that
draws everyone's eyes. The article's Charm Die is automatically
maximized when used in a dice pool.
